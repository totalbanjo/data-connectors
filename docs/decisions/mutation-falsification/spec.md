## Purpose

Provide bounded, reviewable evidence that selected PDPP tests detect plausible trusted faults before the repository invests in shared mutation infrastructure.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Version one SHALL execute only trusted repository adapters

Version one SHALL be a local developer harness with no daemon, queue, server, or network API. It SHALL execute only reviewed, repository-owned adapter and operator identifiers with validated parameters and exact target preimages. It SHALL NOT execute caller-supplied commands, arbitrary patches, or agent-generated source.

#### Scenario: Trusted adapter is requested
- **WHEN** an intent names a registered adapter and valid checked-in operator
- **THEN** repository policy SHALL derive the effective command, environment, judge, and limits

#### Scenario: Arbitrary executable input is requested
- **WHEN** an intent supplies executable source, command arguments, working directory, environment policy, or an unregistered operator
- **THEN** the harness SHALL reject it before execution

### Requirement: Intent, attempt, and triage evidence SHALL remain separate

An intent packet SHALL record the requested risk, trusted adapter and operator descriptors, base identity, and requested budget. An attempt receipt SHALL record immutable machine observations from one execution. A triage receipt SHALL separately record a later reviewer judgment bound to one attempt. The harness SHALL derive conventional killed, survived, or inconclusive projections from valid attempt evidence and SHALL NOT accept those projections or triage dispositions from the intent.

The projection SHALL be conservative and total. Invalid clean evidence, materialization, protocol, authority, retained-artifact, cleanup, timeout, signal, resource, or nondeterminism observations SHALL project to `inconclusive`. A recognized owning-test assertion that passes on the digest-identical clean closure and fails on the mutant SHALL project to `killed`. A focused pass followed by such a complete-backstop failure SHALL also record a selector miss. Only a focused pass plus a complete mutant-backstop pass SHALL project to `survived`. Validated `not_exercised` reachability SHALL project to `inconclusive` pending triage.

#### Scenario: Execution completes
- **WHEN** a trusted adapter produces valid execution evidence
- **THEN** the attempt receipt SHALL preserve baseline, materialization, focused, backstop, reachability, cleanup, timeout, and error observations without adding a human judgment

#### Scenario: Reviewer classifies evidence
- **WHEN** an independent reviewer judges an attempt actionable, likely equivalent, uninteresting, deferred, or invalid
- **THEN** that judgment SHALL be appended as a separate triage receipt with reviewer claim, evidence reference, reason, and timestamp

#### Scenario: Observations are contradictory
- **WHEN** valid attempts for one trial key disagree or a failure is not attributable to an owning-test assertion
- **THEN** the aggregate trial SHALL be inconclusive and the raw attempts SHALL remain visible

### Requirement: Evidence identity and integrity claims SHALL be precise

Evidence SHALL use versioned RFC 8785 JSON canonicalization and SHA-256. The deterministic trial key SHALL bind the intent digest, repository tree, adapter version, policy version, and mutation identity. Each execution SHALL receive a distinct random attempt identifier. Content digests SHALL establish internal consistency or tamper evidence relative to an independently retained digest; they SHALL NOT be represented as issuer authentication.

#### Scenario: Same trial is repeated
- **WHEN** the same bound trial executes more than once
- **THEN** the attempts SHALL share a trial key and SHALL have different attempt identifiers and runtime observations

#### Scenario: Authenticated provenance is unavailable
- **WHEN** evidence is produced only on a developer-controlled host without a trusted signer or platform attestation
- **THEN** provenance SHALL be recorded as a claim and SHALL NOT be described as authenticated identity

### Requirement: The existing migration oracle SHALL retain its purpose-fit lifecycle

The test-migration oracle SHALL retain its existing named mutations, mutation-specific judges, positive control, fixture repositories, and rollback proof. Its structured mode SHALL report the same cases and decisions as its human-readable mode. This adapter SHALL validate structured evidence and crash honesty only; it SHALL NOT be presented as validation of a generic source-mutating executor.

#### Scenario: Structured mode runs successfully
- **WHEN** the existing oracle is run in structured mode
- **THEN** its named cases, catching checks, holes, positive control, and rollback decision SHALL agree with the legacy result

#### Scenario: Structured evidence is incomplete
- **WHEN** output is partial, malformed, omits a case or control, exceeds its bound, or the process is interrupted
- **THEN** the attempt SHALL remain incomplete or invalid and SHALL NOT be projected as killed or survived

### Requirement: Test-accounting authority SHALL NOT be overstated

Focused checks in the domain pilot SHALL be labeled adapter evidence, not test-accounting authority receipts. Repository-owned policy SHALL select the focused check and complete owning-suite backstop. The complete clean backstop SHALL run at the start of each locked pilot batch. The complete mutant backstop SHALL run for every focused survivor. After a focused kill, policy SHALL either run it or record an explicit `not_run_focused_kill` observation. Every backstop that runs SHALL use the unchanged test-accounting authority on a clean committed tree. Before workspace deletion, the verifier SHALL copy and revalidate the complete authority, transcript, completion, receipt, and required closure evidence in its retained bounded store; an attempt SHALL bind the retained locations, sizes, and digests.

Policy SHALL predeclare the evidence root, retained-byte and attempt-count budgets, and retention deadline without evicting prior evidence to admit a run. Completed batch evidence SHALL remain intact through independent review of the decision memo and for at least 30 days afterward. Later deletion SHALL be an explicit audited action.

Clean evidence MAY be reused only inside the same locked batch, for at most two hours, while all bound repository, command, judge, environment, runtime, dependency, and budget identities remain equal and the retained bundle still validates. Reuse SHALL NOT change mutant denominators or hide the raw clean-execution count.

#### Scenario: Focused mutant check passes
- **WHEN** the focused check passes with a trusted mutant present
- **THEN** the mandatory mutant backstop SHALL run; a focused pass followed by a backstop failure SHALL be recorded as a selector miss

#### Scenario: Required backstop cannot complete
- **WHEN** a clean or mutant backstop is missing, fails its baseline, exceeds budget, or cannot issue a valid authority receipt
- **THEN** the attempt SHALL be inconclusive and SHALL NOT count as survived

### Requirement: Domain mutation attempts SHALL be one-shot and bounded

The GroupMe cursor/frontier pilot SHALL use only checked-in declarative fault operators over permitted production paths while the judge and runner closure remain immutable. Each source-mutating attempt SHALL use a fresh clean committed descendant in a disk-backed workspace. A successful workspace SHALL be deleted; an interrupted or cleanup-failed workspace SHALL be quarantined and detected on the next start.

#### Scenario: Trusted domain operator runs
- **WHEN** a registered GroupMe operator matches its exact target preimage
- **THEN** the attempt SHALL record base and mutant trees, permitted changed paths, focused and backstop evidence, environment profile, artifacts, resource observations, and cleanup state

#### Scenario: Attempt is abandoned
- **WHEN** execution ends before a complete receipt and verified cleanup
- **THEN** the issued attempt marker SHALL remain incomplete, its workspace SHALL NOT be reused, and a later run SHALL report or quarantine it

### Requirement: Local execution SHALL use bounded trusted inputs and honest limitations

Repository policy SHALL run one trusted command at a time and SHALL set finite trial-count, wall-time, direct structured-output, workspace-observation, and cleanup budgets. It SHALL distinguish enforced bounds from observations: CPU, memory, task-count, test-accounting transcript bytes, and workspace bytes SHALL NOT be described as hard quotas when the selected mechanism only observes them. The runner SHALL start from an empty environment allowlist and SHALL isolate writable home, temporary, cache, dependency-store, Git, and accounting paths beneath a one-shot attempt root. It SHALL forbid live credentials, personal data, live third-party services, stateful browsers, Docker sockets, and shared production-like databases by policy.

Version one SHALL be an operator-supervised Linux developer experiment. It SHALL NOT claim to be a sandbox, to recover automatically after verifier death, or to establish PDPP product-host portability. Any incomplete marker, unexpected workspace, unexplained process, or cleanup failure SHALL block later runs pending explicit review.

Retiring an interrupted marker SHALL require a separate append-only recovery receipt with operator claim, process and workspace observations, disposition, and retained evidence. It SHALL NOT convert the interrupted attempt into a completed attempt.

#### Scenario: Enforced adapter-local bound is exceeded
- **WHEN** the adapter wall deadline or direct structured-output byte cap is exceeded
- **THEN** the runner SHALL stop its owning process group, verify that no selected-command process remains, retain bounded evidence, record cleanup observations, and mark the attempt inconclusive without claiming crash-durable containment

#### Scenario: Workspace threshold is observed
- **WHEN** workspace observation detects that the advisory byte threshold has been crossed
- **THEN** the harness SHALL stop its owning process group, quarantine the workspace, record the observed overshoot, and SHALL NOT claim that host-disk impact was hard-contained

#### Scenario: Verifier dies after child start
- **WHEN** the verifier exits after publishing an issued marker but before a complete receipt and cleanup evidence
- **THEN** a later run SHALL refuse automatic recovery and SHALL require explicit operator verification of the marker, workspace, and related processes

#### Scenario: Preflight cannot establish the declared profile
- **WHEN** isolated writable paths, empty environment construction, pinned runtime/dependency materialization, hermetic commands, or required adapter-local bounds cannot be established
- **THEN** the harness SHALL refuse the attempt instead of silently weakening the policy

### Requirement: Calibration SHALL end with a pre-registered decision

The pilot SHALL remain advisory and SHALL publish raw counts and defined denominators for valid trials, focused-to-backstop misses, invalid faults, execution failures, cleanup failures, runtime, artifact sizes, and reviewer time. Its valid-result denominator SHALL be exactly killed plus survived; inconclusive, invalid, and not-run attempts SHALL remain separate raw counts. It SHALL stop or narrow on any cleanup failure, abandoned process, unexplained selector miss, dominant setup cost, predominantly invalid or trivial faults, or lack of useful evidence within its declared budget. Shared infrastructure SHALL require a later proposal supported by repeated invariants across both adapters and measured reduction in audit cost.

#### Scenario: Pilot stays within bounds and produces useful evidence
- **WHEN** the two adapters produce interpretable evidence without cleanup failures or unexplained selector misses at acceptable compute and review cost
- **THEN** the decision memo MAY recommend a narrowly scoped shared evidence module and SHALL identify the repeated invariants it would hide

#### Scenario: Pilot does not justify generalization
- **WHEN** signal is weak, costs dominate, safety fails, or the adapters do not share a deep stable boundary
- **THEN** the decision memo SHALL stop or narrow the initiative and retain purpose-fit adapters rather than manufacturing a framework
