/**
 * Build the OCI artifact payload for one Collection Profile connector.
 *
 * This produces the files that `oras push` turns into an OCI image manifest,
 * per OCI-ARTIFACT-DESIGN-0911.md §1. It does NOT push and does NOT sign;
 * those are the workflow's job (.github/workflows/publish-polyfill-connectors.yml),
 * so that the bytes an artifact contains are decided by a script that can be
 * run and tested locally, while credentials stay in CI.
 *
 * Layout written to <out>/:
 *
 *   collection-profile.json   the manifest the runner consumes  (profile layer)
 *   code.tar.gz               esbuild single-file ESM bundle    (code layer)
 *   assets.tar.gz             brand icon, when the manifest declares one
 *   licenses.tar.gz           licence texts that must travel with the bytes
 *   provenance.json           what was built, from what, with what
 *   config.json               the small metadata blob a resolve reads (config)
 *   layers.json               media types + titles, for `oras push` to consume
 *
 * Why the code layer is a bundle rather than the source tree: a connector in
 * packages/polyfill-connectors is NOT self-contained. connectors/oura/index.ts
 * imports ../../src/connector-runtime.ts and four more siblings, so shipping
 * `connectors/oura/` alone ships something that cannot run. Bundling resolves
 * the in-tree graph and leaves only genuine npm packages external, which the
 * declared-externals gate below then forces us to enumerate rather than
 * discover at install time. This mirrors scripts/build-pdpp-artifact.mjs,
 * which solved the same problem for the two PDPP-upstream artifacts.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/build-connector-oci-artifact.mjs --connector oura --out /tmp/oura
 *   [--version 0.1.0]     override the manifest's version (CI passes the tag)
 *   [--esbuild <path>]    resolve esbuild from elsewhere (sandboxes without a
 *                         workspace install)

 * The obvious check — `if (profile.external_tools)` — does not work, and

 * manifests declares `external_tools`; the field does not exist in the tree.
 * Slack nonetheless shells out to a `slackdump` binary it expects on `PATH`,
 * and its bundle builds and imports perfectly cleanly, because a missing
 * subprocess is a RUN-time failure, not a load-time one. Trusting the absent
 * field would therefore have published a Slack artifact that verifies, signs,
 * installs, and then fails on the first collection against a host that happens
 * not to have slackdump installed — the precise failure this distribution path
 * exists to eliminate.
 *
 * So the check is positive: look at what the code actually reaches for.
 *
 *   1. A binary resolved from PATH or an env override. Bundling the binary is
 *      the fix (design §2.5), and it needs a per-platform tool layer plus a
 *      manifest that declares it — neither of which exists yet.
 *   2. A code-relative asset that escapes the install root once the entrypoint
 *      is flattened to `code/collection-profile.mjs`. Slack reads
 *      `new URL("../../config/slackdump-api-config.toml", import.meta.url)`,
 *      which resolves ABOVE the connector's own install root. That is design
 *      §1.3's rewrite obligation, and until the bundler performs the rewrite,
 *      the artifact would be missing a file the code opens.
 *
 * Both are lifted the moment the tool-layer path is implemented. Until then
 * this fails loudly, on a named connector, at build time.
