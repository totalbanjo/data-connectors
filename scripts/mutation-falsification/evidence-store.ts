 * The evidence store: issued/incomplete/completed marker lifecycle plus

 *
 * Lifecycle, matching `scripts/test-accounting/authority.ts`'s `writeNew`
 * fsync-then-fsync-parent-directory discipline:
 *
 *   1. `beginAttempt` — atomically scans and admits one active attempt before
 *      spawning anything; it writes the issued marker with `"wx"`, fsyncs
 *      the file and parent directory, then releases the ledger lock.
 *   2. (adapter/runner spawns, runs, collects observations)
 *   3. `publishCompleteReceipt` — only after structured-output validation,
 *      retained-artifact validation, and cleanup evidence are all in hand.
 *      Atomic publish: write to a temp name in the same directory, fsync,
 *      rename, fsync the parent dir — so a reader never observes a
 *      partially-written file.
 *
 * `beginAttempt` and `scanForIncompleteOrCorrupt` BLOCK a new run (throw) on
 * any issued-but-not-completed or unparseable marker. No age check, no PID-liveness check,
 * no automatic reclamation — matching design.md's explicit rule that "age,
 * PID liveness, and a successful finally block never authorize automatic
 * reclamation." Retiring an incomplete marker requires a separate, explicit,
 * append-only recovery receipt (`recordRecoveryReceipt`) that never flips
 * the attempt to completed.

 *
 *   1. Validate the receipt is bound to its own issued intent (as before).
 *   2. Write+fsync a transaction marker (`phase: "started"`) BEFORE either
 *      the receipt or the chain entry exists — this is the record a
 *      restart-time scan uses to detect and reconcile a half-commit.
 *   3. Write+fsync the receipt to a temp file, NO-REPLACE `link` it to its
 *      final path (fails loudly with EEXIST on a replay), fsync the
 *      markers directory.
 *   4. Advance the transaction marker to `phase: "receipt_committed"`
 *      (fsynced) — the receipt is now durable; only the chain append
 *      remains.
 *   5. Verify+recompute the current chain head under the lock, append the
 *      new entry, fsync the chain file's own fd AND its parent directory.
 *   6. Delete the transaction marker (fsynced) — only now is this attempt
 *      considered fully committed.
 *
 * A crash at any point before step 6 leaves a transaction marker behind;
 * `scanForIncompleteOrCorrupt` treats any leftover marker as blocking
 * (fail-closed) unless it can PROVE full commit (matching receipt +
 * matching chain entry), in which case it reconciles by deleting the
 * stale marker — see that function's own doc comment.
