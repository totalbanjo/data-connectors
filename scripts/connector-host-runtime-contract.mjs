/**
 * The host-runtime contract: the written-down, versioned answer to "which bytes
 * ship inside a connector artifact, and which capabilities does the supported
 * runtime provide?"
 *
 * Before this file existed the builder left EVERY npm dependency external and
 * recorded, as provenance, values like `file:./vendor/pdpp-connector-protocol-0.0.1.tgz`
 * — a path relative to THIS repository. A consumer cannot install that. The
 * verifier hid the gap by symlinking its scratch install's node_modules at the
 * publisher's own node_modules, which proves the bundle runs against the
 * publisher's checkout and proves nothing about a release.
 *
 * The rule now has two halves, and both are enforced rather than assumed:
 *
 *   1. Anything statically reachable from the entrypoint is BUNDLED. If the
 *      module graph reaches it at load time, its bytes travel in code.tar.gz.
 *   2. Anything left external must appear in HOST_PROVIDED below, must be
 *      reached only through a dynamic import, and is therefore never needed to
 *      load the module — only to perform an operation the host already had to
 *      provision.
 *
 * A static import of a host-provided package is a CONTRACT VIOLATION and fails
 * the build, because it would make module loading depend on bytes the artifact
 * does not carry. That is precisely the failure this contract exists to stop.
 *
 * Why these packages, and only these: they drive a real browser. Bundling
 * patchright's JavaScript would not help, because the thing it needs is a
 * downloaded Chromium install and a matching host OS — bytes an artifact cannot
 * carry in any useful sense (the design explicitly does not bundle an OS).
 * better-sqlite3 is a compiled native addon for the host's ABI. Shipping the
 * per-platform tool layer is tracked as separate work; until it lands, a
 * connector that STATICALLY needs any of these fails the build by name.
 */
