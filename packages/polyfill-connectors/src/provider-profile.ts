 * ProviderProfile — the single declared home for every provider-specific
 * safety- / pressure- / terminal-shaped quantity (SLVP-ideal spec §3, §9-C5).
 *
 * THE RULE (spec §3 rule 6): "lift every provider-specific quantity out of
 * shared defaults into a required `ProviderProfile` that each connector author
 * must declare from THEIR OWN provider's observed behavior. No shared default
 * for a safety- or pressure-shaped quantity — a missing field is a build error,
 * not a silent borrow of ChatGPT's number."
 *
 * This file is the ONE source of truth for that field set. The three control
 * loops that consume it each take their slice as a NON-OPTIONAL argument so a
 * connector wired onto a loop without a declared profile fails at the type
 * boundary (the governor's `pacingMinIntervalMs`) or at a loud startup assertion
 * (`maybeTerminateGap` throws; the cooldown escalation no-ops on an absent
 * value). See the per-field notes below for which mechanism pins which field.
 *
 * WHY THESE FIELDS (and not the cosmetic knobs): a field belongs here iff
 * getting it wrong off the wrong provider's numbers risks a ban, a stall, or a
 * dishonest health verdict — i.e. it is safety-, pressure-, or terminal-shaped.
 * Discovery seeds, burst-tolerance, and AIMD horizons are derived/cosmetic and
 * stay shared-defaulted in the loop primitives; they are NOT forced here.
 *
 * Audit status (§9-C5): the FIELD SET and ChatGPT's values are
 * observation-backed (live ChatGPT probes 2026-06). The other five governor-using
 * connectors (github/notion/oura/spotify/ynab) now each carry an AUDITED
 * pacing ceiling derived from THAT provider's documented rate limit — the WI-1b
 * per-connector behavioral audit. Each value traces to a provider doc URL in its
 * factory below; the derivation (documented sustained rate → chosen ceiling +
 * safety margin) is recorded in
 * docs/research/per-connector-rate-profiles-2026-06-13.md. None of the five emit
 * detail gaps, so none declares a terminal-gap (§10-A) or cooldown (§10-B)
 * profile — they legitimately use the safe shared defaults (see that doc).
