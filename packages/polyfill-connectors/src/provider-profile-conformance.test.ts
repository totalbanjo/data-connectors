/**
 * ProviderProfile conformance (SLVP-ideal spec §3, §9-C5).
 *
 * The spec's bar is: "every provider-specific quantity is a declared
 * ProviderProfile field with no shared default — a missing field is a BUILD
 * ERROR, not a silent borrow of ChatGPT's number." This suite PINS that bar for
 * the governor-using (API) connectors. It is the test that fails if the
 * requirement is ever weakened back to an optional field with a shared default.
 *
 * WI-1b status: all six governor-using connectors are now AUDITED — each declares
 * a per-connector pacing ceiling derived from its provider's documented limit
 * (src/provider-profile.ts, doc-cited; derivations in
 * docs/research/per-connector-rate-profiles-2026-06-13.md). The unaudited 1000ms
 * placeholder helper and its GAP-3 forcing function (which existed only to keep
 * the placeholder from ossifying) have been RETIRED now that the audit is
 * complete. The structural conformance below — required `profile`, no 250 borrow,
 * no roster drift — is permanent and outlives the audit.
 *
 * Two enforcement layers are proven here:
 *   1. COMPILE-TIME (the primary mechanism): `profile` is a required field on
 *      `ConnectorHttpGovernorOptions`, so a bare `createConnectorHttpGovernor
 *      ({ name })` is a `tsc` error. The `@ts-expect-error` below is the
 *      executable proof — if the field is ever made optional again, the
 *      suppression becomes unused and `tsc --noEmit` fails. (The terminal-gap
 *      and cooldown slices are .js seams; their build-error equivalent is the
 *      loud throw + their own conformance assertions in the reference-
 *      implementation SLVP suites.)
 *   2. RUNTIME BACKSTOP: a JS caller (no tsc) that omits the profile must fail
 *      LOUD, never silently borrow a shared default.
 *
 * Plus a registry conformance over each governor-using connector's SOURCE: the
 * scan is static (no module import) so it is hang-proof — importing real
 * connector modules leaves keep-alive sockets open and would wedge the runner.
 * The static scan + the compile-time required field together guarantee every
 * shipped connector that uses the shared governor declares a ProviderProfile.
