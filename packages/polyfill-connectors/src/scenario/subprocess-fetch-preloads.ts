/**
 * Shared subprocess/fetch-bridge plumbing for the scenario-record and
 * scenario-verify developer CLIs (bin/scenario-record.ts,
 * bin/scenario-verify.ts).
 *
 * EXTRACTED FROM (by copy, not by import — the source stays untouched):
 * connectors/oura/scenario.spike.test.ts's `writeRecordPreload`,
 * `writeReplayBridgePreload`, and `startFetchBridgeServer`. That spike wrote
 * a preload that embedded a hardcoded SYNTHETIC oura provider inline in the
 * generated source (`providerResponseFor.toString()` + JSON-literal fixture
 * data) because its `fetch` had nowhere real to go. This module drops that
 * synthetic-provider concern entirely: the record preload here wraps
 * whatever `fetch` already exists in the subprocess (the real global, or
 * Node's default) — that's the right shape for a CLI whose job is to talk to
 * either the real live network (bin/scenario-record.ts's normal use) or a
 * test's own loopback HTTP server (bin/scenario-cli.test.ts's stub
 * connector), never a baked-in fixture. The redaction/capture logic itself
 * (credential query-param stripping, body-size cap, seq numbering, header
 * allowlisting, provider-issued-value binding) is kept in lockstep with
 * record.ts's `createRecordingFetch`/`collectRedactedQueryParams` so the
 * subprocess's hand-rolled recorder matches the in-process one's contract as
 * closely as the two independent runtimes (in-process function vs. a
 * generated `.mjs` module string executed in a separate OS process) allow.
 *
 * Two preload flavors, matching the spike's design:
 *   - RECORD: patches `globalThis.fetch` to record every interaction to an
 *     in-memory array and flush it to `outPath` as JSON on process exit.
 *     Requests pass through to whatever `fetch` already resolves to in the
 *     subprocess (real network by default).
 *   - REPLAY: patches `globalThis.fetch`, `http.request`/`http.get`,
 *     `https.request`/`https.get`, and `net.Socket.prototype.connect` (the
 *     shared choke point under `net.connect`/`net.createConnection` too —
 *     see `writeReplayBridgePreload`'s docstring). `fetch` forwards every
 *     request over a loopback bridge to the parent process, whose handler is
 *     the REAL `createReplayFetch(run, scenario.normalizers)` instance
 *     `verifyScenario` constructs — so the actual matcher/
 *     `assertAllConsumed` machinery in replay.ts is exercised, not a
 *     reimplementation. `fetch` + `http` + `https` + `net` egress is denied
 *     for anything other than the bridge itself: a connector calling
 *     `node:http`/`node:https`/`node:net` directly fails loudly instead of
 *     silently reaching a real server. `child_process`-spawned network
 *     clients are out of scope for the JS-layer denial in THIS module — see
 *     isolation.ts for the OS-layer (network namespace) closure of that gap.
 *
 * Both preloads must be installed via `NODE_OPTIONS=--import <path>` (not a
 * CLI `--import` flag) so they run before tsx registers the connector's
 * module and before the connector's own top-level code (which may call
 * `runConnector(...)` unconditionally at module scope, as oura does) ever
 * executes — see the spike's module docstring for the empirical confirmation
 * that NODE_OPTIONS's --import always wins that race.
 *
 * ─── Secure evidence workspace (FIX 4) ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every temp file this module creates (generated preload `.mjs` modules, the
 * record preload's flushed capture JSON) now lives inside a per-call `mkdtemp`
 * directory created 0700, with every file inside it written 0600 — not
 * loose in the shared OS tmpdir root, where any other local user/process
 * could read a real developer's captured request/response bodies (which may
 * contain real personal data — `capture.privacy_class: "local-only"` in
 * format.ts exists precisely because these captures are NOT safe to treat as
 * public). `createScenarioEvidenceWorkspace()` creates the directory;
 * `cleanupScenarioEvidenceWorkspace(workspace)` removes it — callers MUST
 * invoke the cleanup helper on every terminal path (success, failure, and
 * thrown-before-either) of whatever CLI/test constructs a workspace.

 * (body hash, header allowlist, seq-at-initiation, truncation/
 * pending-counter honesty signals, provenance bindings), and writes the
 * `RecordPreloadCaptureEnvelope` to `outPath` as JSON on process exit (the
 * only way to get data out of a separate OS process back to the parent
 * CLI/test).
 *
 * SIGNATURE COMPATIBILITY: `writeRecordPreload(outPath)` (the pre-existing
 * two-arg-less call shape `bin/scenario-record.ts` uses today) still works
 * unchanged — `workspace` is optional and, when omitted, this function
 * creates and owns a throwaway workspace for just the preload module itself
 * (the existing caller still passes its own `capturePath` for `outPath`
 * directly, unaffected by FIX 4's workspace convention until that CLI is
 * updated to pass one explicitly — another lane's follow-up). Passing an
 * explicit `workspace` (this task's FIX 4 usage) additionally places the
 * generated preload module inside that 0700 directory instead of a
 * one-off implicit one, and is the form new call sites should prefer.
 *

 * FIX (b) BINDINGS: per format.ts's `ScenarioBinding` doc comment, a
 * credential-name-matching query param whose value equals a string leaf of
 * an EARLIER recorded response body in this run is not persisted raw — a
 * `{param, source_seq, json_path}` binding entry is recorded on the
 * interaction instead, and the param is excluded from the stored query
 * entirely (neither the raw value nor a normalizer entry for it — the
 * binding itself, plus replay resolving the expected value from the
 * response it actually served for `source_seq`, is what proves the value
 * without ever persisting it). A credential-named param with NO such
 * provenance (a genuine client secret) is still redacted+normalized exactly
 * as before.
 *
 * FIX (e)/(f) PENDING-COUNTER + CRASH SEMANTICS: `pendingCount` increments
 * immediately before calling `underlying()` and decrements immediately after
 * `sink`-equivalent persistence (the `interactions.push`) completes for that
 * request. A `process.on("exit")` handler reads whatever `pendingCount`
 * holds at that moment — non-zero means a fire-and-forget request (started,
 * never awaited by the connector, process exits anyway) lost its result
 * silently; that count is surfaced as `pendingAtExit` rather than pretending
 * the capture is complete. `process.on("uncaughtExceptionMonitor", ...)` is
 * used instead of `process.on("uncaughtException", ...)` specifically
 * because `uncaughtException` is a BEHAVIOR-ALTERING listener — Node treats
 * ANY listener on that event as "the application has decided to handle this
 * itself," which suppresses Node's default action (print the stack trace,
 * exit non-zero) entirely; a preload installing one would silently change
 * whether a connector crash is fatal, which is exactly the kind of
 * observable-behavior change record-time instrumentation must never cause.
 * `uncaughtExceptionMonitor` listeners are observation-only by design — Node
 * still runs its default fatal handling afterward — so this preload can flag
 * `incomplete` truthfully without altering crash semantics.

 *
 * RATIONALE: every response the replaying connector sees is served from a
 * local recording — there is no live provider on the other end — so a
 * connector's own inter-request pacing (whether it runs through the shared
 * HTTP governor's `ProviderPacing`, or a connector's inline
 * `setTimeout`-based delay like venmo/reddit's PAGE_DELAY) has nothing left
 * to protect during replay. Time itself is an effect this harness already
 * virtualizes for replay determinism (see `Date.now()`/`new Date()` patching
 * below, gated on `FIXED_NOW_ISO`) — scaling `setTimeout`/`setInterval` is
 * the same idea applied to wall-clock delays: a connector's pacing/backoff
 * CONTROL FLOW (how many times it waits, in what order, relative to which
 * other waits) survives untouched, but the actual wall-clock cost collapses
 * to roughly 1% of the recorded run. This turns iterate-against-the-
 * recording into seconds instead of minutes, which is the terminal developer
 * loop `bin/scenario-verify.ts` exists to serve.
 *
 * SCALE, NOT SKIP: an earlier design skipped the shared governor's pacing
 * sleep outright via an env-var check inside `src/provider-pacing.ts`. That
 * approach was rejected on review for two reasons: (1) it makes PRODUCTION
 * pacing machinery aware of its caller's execution mode via env
 * action-at-a-distance, a concern that belongs to the harness driving
 * replay, not the pacing primitive itself; and (2) it only covered the one
 * connector class that routes through `createConnectorHttpGovernor` —
 * connectors with their own inline delay (e.g. a bare
 * `setTimeout`-based PAGE_DELAY) would keep re-sleeping in full during
 * replay, since nothing there reads the env flag. Scaling every timer at the
 * one shared choke point (`globalThis.setTimeout`/`setInterval`, patched only
 * inside THIS harness-owned replay preload) fixes both: production code
 * never learns it is being replayed, and every timer-based delay — governor
 * pacing, inline PAGE_DELAY sleeps, anything else built on the same two
 * primitives — is covered uniformly.
 *
 * RELATIVE ORDERING IS PRESERVED (not fire-immediately): scaling a delay by a
 * constant factor keeps a longer wait longer than a shorter one (a 20s pace
 * becomes 200ms; a 30s backoff becomes 300ms; the backoff still fires AFTER
 * the pace it followed). Collapsing every delay to 0 instead would not: two
 * timers scheduled in a specific relative order could then fire in
 * event-loop registration order instead, silently changing a connector's
 * observable control flow (e.g. a retry-before-pace vs pace-before-retry
 * race) — exactly the kind of behavior change replay must not introduce.

/**
 * Writes a REPLAY-phase preload module and returns its path. The preload

 * `options.udsSocketPath` is passed here), over that Unix domain socket
 * instead — rather than matching interactions itself, so the parent's real
 * `createReplayFetch` — the same instance `verifyScenario` tracks for
 * `assertAllConsumed()` — is the actual code exercised.
 *
 * SIGNATURE COMPATIBILITY: `writeReplayBridgePreload(bridgeUrl)` (the
 * pre-existing single-argument call shape `bin/scenario-verify.ts` uses
 * today) still works unchanged — `options` (including `options.workspace`)
 * is optional and, when omitted, this function creates and owns a
 * throwaway workspace for just the preload module. Passing
 * `options.workspace` explicitly (this task's FIX 4 usage) places the
 * generated preload inside that shared 0700 directory instead, and is the
 * form new call sites should prefer.
 *
 * EGRESS DENIAL SCOPE (v1, JS layer): this preload patches `globalThis.fetch`,
 * `http.request`/`http.get`, `https.request`/`https.get`, and
 * `net.Socket.prototype.connect` — the complete set of Node built-in entry
 * points a connector could use to open an outbound connection without going
 * through `fetch`. A connector calling `node:http`/`node:https`/`node:net`
 * directly now fails loudly with a `ScenarioEgressDeniedError`-style message
 * naming the API it called, instead of silently reaching a real server.
 * `child_process`-spawned clients (a connector shelling out to `curl`,
 * another `node` process with its own network stack, etc.) are OUT OF SCOPE
 * for this JS-layer preload — this module does not intercept process
 * spawning. Closing that gap at the OS layer (network namespaces) is
 * isolation.ts's job, wired in by the CLI (another lane's follow-up); the
 * UDS bridge mode this preload supports exists specifically so that
 * OS-layer isolation remains compatible with the bridge still working (see
 * isolation.ts's module docstring for why TCP loopback can't cross a netns
 * boundary but a UDS can).
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: Node's built-in module namespace objects returned by
 * `import http from "node:http"` (a default import) is NOT a frozen ESM
 * namespace object — it is the same mutable object CJS `require("http")`
 * returns, with every export an own, writable, non-configurable data
 * property (verified empirically: `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(http,
 * "request").writable === true`). Reassigning `http.request = ...`
 * therefore really does redirect every later default-style
 * `import`/`require` of `node:http` in this process, including the
 * connector's own module, if it imports the same way this preload does.
 * NAMED imports (`import { get } from "node:http"`) do NOT see this
 * reassignment — Node synthesizes those as bindings on a genuinely frozen
 * ESM namespace object (confirmed empirically: `import * as httpNs from
 * "node:http"; httpNs.get = ...` throws `TypeError: Cannot assign to read
 * only property`), a separate object from the default-export one this
 * preload patches. A connector using a named import bypasses the
 * `http.get`/`http.request`/`https.get`/`https.request` denials below —
 * but NOT the actual network boundary, because of the next paragraph.
 *
 * `net.Socket.prototype.connect` (also writable, and NOT subject to the
 * named-vs-default-import split above since it's a shared class prototype,
 * not a rebindable module export) is the actual network choke point patched
 * here, NOT `net.connect`/`net.createConnection` themselves: `net.connect`,
 * `net.createConnection`, `http`/`https` (however imported), and `fetch`
 * (undici) all construct a raw `net.Socket` internally and call
 * `.connect(...)` on it — confirmed empirically by wrapping the prototype
 * method and observing `net.connect(port, host)`, `http.get(...)` (both
 * default- and named-imported), and `fetch(...)` (via undici) all route
 * through it. Patching only the top-level `net.connect`/`net.createConnection`
 * factory functions would (a) miss `new net.Socket().connect(...)` entirely
 * and (b) — discovered while building this fix — break the bridge itself,
 * since undici calls `net.connect` directly for the bridge's own outbound
 * request (TCP mode only). UDS mode uses `http.request({socketPath})`, but
 * that call still internally constructs a `net.Socket` and calls
 * `.connect({path: socketPath, ...})` on it — `path`, not `socketPath`,
 * is the field Node's http module actually sets on the connect-options
 * object it hands to `net.Socket.prototype.connect` (confirmed
 * empirically) — so it DOES route through this same prototype method, and
 * the guard below carries an explicit `path === UDS_PATH` allowlist branch
 * for it, alongside the existing host+port branch for the TCP bridge.
 * Patching the one shared
 * prototype method closes the raw-socket gap AND the named-import gap in
 * one place, and the two allowlist checks (TCP bridge host+port, UDS
 * bridge's own socket path) keep the bridge's own call working in either
 * mode while still denying every other destination.
 *
 * `http.request`/`http.get`/`https.request`/`https.get` are denied
 * unconditionally on the default-export object in TCP mode (the bridge
 * never calls them in that mode, only `fetch`). In UDS mode, this preload's
 * OWN bridge client uses `http.request({socketPath})` directly — the denial
 * wrapper is installed AFTER the preload captures its own reference to the
 * real `http.request`, so the connector still sees the denial while the
 * preload's internal bridge call is unaffected.

 *  P1-1 (seventh review, wire-registry duty-2) + P2 (eighth review,
 *  wire-registry STATE duty): RECORD and STATE now actually share the
 *  strict-parser policy the previous version of this comment merely CLAIMED
 *  — every RECORD message is validated via `assertValidRecordMessage`
 *  (wire-registry.ts) and every STATE message via `assertValidStateMessage`
 *  (same file, added this wave), BOTH before this function reads any of
 *  their fields: RECORD's nonempty `stream`, valid `key` (string, or
 *  string[] of nonempty strings), object-shaped `data`, string `emitted_at`,
 *  and `op` absent-or-`"delete"`; STATE's nonempty `stream` and a REQUIRED
 *  (even if `null`-valued) `cursor` property. Enforced uniformly for both
 *  the recording side (bin/scenario-record.ts) and the replaying side
 *  (bin/scenario-verify.ts), since both route every subprocess RECORD/STATE
 *  through this one function — a malformed RECORD/STATE now fails recording
 *  and replay instead of being silently dropped or absorbed into a
 *  best-effort projection (previously true for RECORD; STATE had NO
 *  wire-boundary check at all before this wave — a STATE message missing
 *  `cursor`, or carrying a non-string/empty `stream`, previously either
 *  silently vanished from `stateMessages` (`typeof msg.stream === "string"`
 *  was the only prior gate, so `stream: ""` passed straight through) or
 *  read `msg.cursor` as `undefined` with no signal that the field was ever
 *  absent). A message that fails either check throws
 *  `MalformedRecordMessageError`/`MalformedStateMessageError` — matching
 *  this package's "strict parsers reject, never sanitize" policy (verify.ts's
 *  `TraceNormalizationError` doc comment states the same policy for the
 *  protocol-trace oracle; this is the RECORD/STATE oracle's actual
 *  equivalent, not just a comment claiming one). The pre-existing
 *  unsupported-key-shape throw below is unreachable in practice (a key that
 *  fails `isValidRecordKey` already fails `assertValidRecordMessage` first)
 *  but is kept as a defense-in-depth invariant, not removed. */
