 *
 * `bin/scenario-verify.ts` used to print `recorded_replay: PASS` the moment
 * every per-run comparison passed — but a passing comparison only proves the
 * REPLAY matched what was recorded; it says nothing about whether the
 * replay's PROVENANCE and ISOLATION actually back the stronger claim that
 * printed line makes (a real registered connector, a genuine capture-time
 * declaration digest AND a genuine capture-time source digest EACH bound to
 * the current subject's freshly-recomputed counterpart, every run declaring
 * the transport it was captured over, a protocol-trace oracle present, the
 * replay actually run under OS-level network isolation rather than the
 * weaker process-local-only fallback, no run having exercised an evidence
 * surface — ASSISTANCE — this offline oracle cannot observe, and the
 * declared driver's own minimum-evidence bar actually being met — see
 * `wire-registry.ts`'s `DRIVER_EVIDENCE_POLICIES`). Nine independent
 * conditions, any one of which failing means `recorded_replay: PASS`
 * overclaims.
 *
 * `evaluateClaimEligibility` is the SINGLE place that decides this. It never
 * decides pass/fail (that remains `verifyScenario`'s job, unconditionally,
 * before this function is ever consulted) — it only decides WHICH positive
 * claim a passing verification is allowed to print:
 *   - every condition holds: `recorded_replay: PASS` is honest.
 *   - any condition fails: only the weaker `diagnostic_replay: PASS` is
 *     honest, printed alongside `recorded_replay: WITHHELD` and the specific
 *     `limitations` that caused the downgrade — so the failure mode is named,
 *     not just silently softer language.
 *
 * RECORDED-BROWSER IS STRUCTURALLY CAPPED AT `diagnostic_replay` — never an
 * oversight, a permanent, machine-enforced ceiling. `everyRunDeclaresRecordedHttpDriver`
 * below checks the literal `"recorded-http"`; a scenario whose runs declare
 * `"recorded-browser"` fails that condition on EVERY replay, by construction,
 * so `recorded_replay: PASS` is unreachable for a browser-driven scenario no
 * matter how many other conditions it satisfies. This is deliberate: a
 * browser replay proves DATA MAPPING (recorded network responses -> emitted
 * records), not page choreography (anti-bot JS and timer nondeterminism make
 * click/navigation sequences non-deterministically replayable), so it must
 * never read as equivalent to `recorded-http`'s stronger claim. See
 * `buildBrowserStalenessLimitation` below for the second, independent
 * enforcement this driver adds: even the weaker `diagnostic_replay: PASS` a
 * passing browser scenario earns always carries a limitation naming the
 * exact capture timestamp it was verified against, so no report or reader
 * can quote a passing browser replay without that disclaimer riding along.
