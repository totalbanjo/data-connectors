// ─── Probe-honesty: advertise-vs-honor (forced PID-ns procfs-mount refusal) ─
//
// An independent review found a concrete host shape — Docker `--cap-add=
// SYS_ADMIN` granted without full `--privileged`, so Docker's default
// procfs-subpath masking is still active — where `unshare -r -n true`
// (the OLD probe's entire check) succeeds, but the PID-namespace's own
// `mount -t proc proc /proc` is refused by the kernel's "too revealing"
// check. Under the old probe, that host reported `available: true`,
// `unshare` got selected over `bwrap`, and the real spawn then ran to
// completion with `/proc` silently mounted-but-empty. Reproducing that
// exact container shape here (a real Docker container with real kernel
// behavior) isn't practical inside this fast test suite, so these tests
// simulate the SAME two-part failure signature (namespace creation exits 0,
// procfs mount then fails) with a fake `unshare` shim on PATH — proving the
// PROBE's own logic correctly turns that signature into `available: false`
// with a diagnostic naming the refusal, and that the runtime then falls back
// to bwrap (or fails closed) rather than silently proceeding. This is a
// logic-level proof of the fix, complementary to (not a replacement for) the
// live container reproduction recorded in the review notes.

// INJECTION MECHANISM (P1, external review of ab415be6c — trusted launcher
// resolution): these two tests used to shadow `unshare`/`bwrap` via a
// PATH-prepended fake-bin directory. Now that both the probe and the real
// execution resolve the launcher through `resolveTrustedLauncherPath` (a
// fixed allowlist, never the caller's `$PATH`), that injection no longer
// reaches anything — proving the fix, but also meaning a test still relying
// on it would silently stop exercising the fallback logic. Both fakes are
// now installed via bind-mounting DIRECTLY OVER the real trusted-path
// `unshare`/`bwrap` binaries (`withShimmedTrustedBinary`, same technique the
// setup-command forced-failure tests below already use), nested so both
// binaries are shimmed for the duration of each test.

// launchers exec their closure script into — both `unshareProcMountProbeArgv()`
// (the probe) and `spawnWithNetworkIsolation`'s `unshare` branch (the real
// execution) passed the bare string `"sh"` as an argv entry to the
// already-trusted `unshare` binary (`unshare ... -- sh -c <script>`).
// `unshare` performs `execvp("sh", ...)` on that argv entry, and `execvp`
// resolves a bare name through the PATH environment variable of the process
// PERFORMING THE EXEC at that moment — the calling Node process's own
// `spawn()` env, fully caller-controlled — NOT `TRUSTED_SETUP_PATH` (that
// assignment is the FIRST STATEMENT INSIDE the very script the fake `sh`
// would be asked to interpret, too late to matter: a fake `sh` can ignore it,
// skip straight to running the connector unisolated, and still report
// success).
//
// A trivial marker-touch-and-exit-0 fake would only prove the fake was never
// invoked — it would NOT prove the specific exploit this closes, because a
// naive test could pass by coincidence (e.g. if isolation still worked via
// some other path). These fakes are FUNCTIONING substitutes instead: the
// probe fake prints the real success sentinel and exits 0 WITHOUT performing
// the actual `--map-root-user --net --mount --pid --ipc --uts --fork` mount
// sequence a real `sh` would (it can't, since only a real trusted `sh` would
// even receive namespace capabilities in a way that matters — the fake just
// unconditionally claims success), and the execution fake execs the target
// command directly with no filesystem closure or network isolation at all —
// exactly what "a fake sh silently reports success and skips real
// containment" looks like if this fix were absent. Each still touches its
// own marker file so the test can assert, directly, that it was never

// ─── Fail-closed setup — forced-failure controls for every mandatory step ──
//
// P1-1 (ninth review): the OLD `filesystemClosureShellPrelude` discarded the
// exit status of EVERY mandatory setup step (staging tmpfs create+mount,
// oldroot dir creation, every required bind, every ro remount,
// `mount --make-rprivate /`, `pivot_root`, `umount -l /oldroot`) via
// `>/dev/null 2>&1` and joined them with `;` — so ANY of these failing left
// the isolated child executing the target command anyway, against a
// filesystem closure that silently never took effect. The fix wraps every
// one of these in `req` (isolation.ts's `reqStatement`/`REQ_FUNCTION_DEFINITION`),
// which halts the whole prelude — never reaching `exec <target>` — the
// instant any ONE of them fails.
//
// Each test below forces exactly one of these steps to fail (via the same
// bind-mount-over-the-real-trusted-binary injection `canBindMountOverAFile`
// proved works, now that PATH-shadowing no longer reaches these commands —
// see the previous test's doc comment) and proves the TARGET COMMAND NEVER
// RAN: the target writes a marker file to a location OUTSIDE the isolated
// child's own view (the real host's `os.tmpdir()`, reachable from this test
// process directly) the instant it starts — if that marker exists after the
// spawn closes, the target ran despite the forced failure, which is exactly
// the silent-proceed defect this hardening closes. A nonzero exit code alone
// is not accepted as proof (a real target crash for an unrelated reason
// would also exit nonzero); only the marker's absence is.

/** Runs `spawnWithNetworkIsolation` under the `unshare` mechanism with a
 *  target command that writes `markerPath` (a real host path, created OUTSIDE
 *  any isolated child's view) the moment it starts, then reports whether that
 *  marker exists after the child closes — the authoritative "did the target
 *  command actually run" signal every forced-failure test below checks. */
/**
 * `markerPath` for the FORCED-FAILURE tests below is deliberately left
 * unreachable inside the isolated child's own view (a plain `os.tmpdir()`
 * path, not inside any `filesystemBindPath`) — for those tests this is
 * immaterial: a forced setup-step failure means the write is never even
 * ATTEMPTED (the whole prelude halts before `exec <target>`), so
 * `markerWritten` staying `false` proves the same thing regardless of
 * whether `/tmp` itself would have been reachable. The ONE happy-path test
 * (`"a genuinely successful filesystem closure ... DOES run"`) needs the
 * opposite proof — that a successful run's marker WRITE actually lands — so
 * it must pass a `filesystemBindPath` the marker lives inside (see that
 * test's own call site): without one, the marker write would fail with
 * ENOENT for the CORRECT reason (the default-deny root has no `/tmp` at
 * all — proving the closure works, not that it's broken) and this helper
 * would misreport that as `markerWritten: false` either way, indistinguishable

// walk compared awk's RAW (still-escaped) field-5 token directly against a
// PLAIN (unescaped) staged path — a raw `/tmp/x\040y` token never equals or
// prefix-matches the plain string `/tmp/x y`, so a real, space-containing
// submount was silently OMITTED from both the setup-time remount and this
// post-pivot verification. Separately, the old verification probed a
// submount by `touch <path>/.probe` — creating a file INSIDE it — which is
// meaningless for a FILE bind mount (no "inside" to touch); confirmed
// empirically this makes `touch` fail with ENOTDIR regardless of the file
// mount's actual read-only state, a false negative that reports a still-
// writable file submount as "confirmed read-only."

// directly must invoke the probe binaries ZERO times, while passing a bare

// its own PID namespace: only `--unshare-net` was passed, so `--proc /proc`
// mounted a fresh procfs INSTANCE that still reflected the HOST's PID
// namespace (procfs is a view keyed by the mounting process's PID namespace
// membership, independent of the mount being freshly created). Reproduced:
// an isolated child's `ls /proc | grep -cE '^[0-9]+$'` showed 1683 of 1681
// host processes — essentially the entire host process table — and could
// read `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` (full argv, which routinely carries secrets:
// `--token=...`, connection strings) for an arbitrary unrelated live host
// process, including PID 1. `unshare --pid --fork` already avoided this
// (same probe: 7, only the child's own tiny subtree).
//
// This section proves the fix (`--unshare-pid` added to the bwrap argv,
// composing with the pre-existing `--unshare-net`) with the SAME two-part
// signature the reviewer's repro used: a small process-count bound AND a
// failed foreign-cmdline read — either alone is weaker evidence (a low count
// with a readable foreign cmdline would mean the count is deceptive; a
// failed single read with no count check wouldn't prove the isolated child
// can't see anything ELSE on the host).

// ─── Pathname-UDS filesystem escape — default-deny negative controls ──────
//
// Two independent review passes on the earlier mask-list repair:
//
// Pass 1 (external review): `--net`/`--unshare-net` only constrains the
// NETWORK namespace. A native descendant the isolated child spawns — `curl
// --unix-socket <path>`, never routed through this package's JS-layer
// fetch/http/net patching at all — could dial ANY pathname UDS reachable on
// the shared filesystem, because the isolated child's filesystem view was
// left completely unrestricted. Reported repro: `unshare -r -n -- curl
// --unix-socket /tmp/foreign.sock http://localhost/probe`.
//
// Pass 2 (independent second review, against the mask-list repair for pass
// 1): proved mask-listing cannot terminate. With `--dev-bind / /` still in
// place, the reachable set was always "every path not yet added to the
// list" — the reviewer reached a real ssh-agent socket under
// `$HOME/.ssh/agent/`, a real `/run/user/<uid>` socket, and an arbitrary
// `$HOME`-rooted path, none of them ever addressable by growing a mask
// list. The reviewer ALSO proved the negative controls that existed at the
// time were a false-pass mechanism: `startForeignUdsServer` called
// `server.listen()` without awaiting the `'listening'` event, so on a
// slower filesystem/loaded CI runner the isolated child's curl could lose
// the race against the socket actually being bound — and an UNBOUND socket
// produces curl_exit=7 (connection refused, "no such file") + hits()==0,
// EXACTLY the signature the assertions accept as "escape closed." Green in
// that world proved nothing.
//
// This section fixes both: `startForeignUdsServer` now resolves only after
// `'listening'` fires (and rejects on `'error'`), so every test below
// awaits a REAL bound socket before the isolated child ever attempts to
// connect — no race window to lose. And the isolation under test is now
// `isolation.ts`'s default-deny root (see that module's doc comment),
// tested against the exact three real-world locations the reviewer
// reproduced: an arbitrary `$HOME`-rooted path (P1.1), an ssh-agent-shaped
// path under `$HOME/.ssh/agent/` (P1.2 — the socket that actually matters,
// since the earlier `/run/user/<uid>` fix closed a DIFFERENT, unused
// agent socket), and `/run/user/<uid>` itself (regression coverage for the
// fix that preceded this one). A POSITIVE control (below) proves a
// non-isolated child CAN reach each of these sockets, so a passing negative
// control is meaningful rather than vacuous (e.g. curl not being on PATH).
//
// Passing (closing the escape) requires BOTH: the curl connect attempt
// fails, AND the foreign server's own hit counter — the authoritative
// signal, since a compromised/malicious child could lie about its own exit
// code — stays at zero.

// ─── Guard: no future edit may reintroduce --dev-bind / / ─────────────────
//
// The whole point of the default-deny rewrite is that the bwrap argv never
// contains a bind of the real host root, and never binds anything outside
// `requiredFilesystemBinds()` plus the one caller-supplied
// `filesystemBindPath`. This test asserts that MECHANICALLY, independent of
// whether any specific foreign-socket probe above happens to catch a
// regression — so a future edit that widens the bind set (e.g. reverting to
// `--dev-bind / /`, or adding a new bind without updating this test) fails
// here even if no test author remembers to add a new location above.
//
// An independent review of an earlier version of this guard found it too
// narrow: it asserted every --bind/--ro-bind SOURCE it found was a member of
// the allowlist, but never checked the argv's bind set was EXACTLY the
// allowlist — so an extra, undeclared bind whose source happened to collide
// with an allowlisted path (or a widened MODE on an allowlisted path, e.g.
// flipping a `--ro-bind` to `--bind`) could slip through uncaught. This
// version instead extracts every (flag, source, dest) bind triple from the
// argv and asserts that SET, as a whole, equals the derived allowlist plus
// filesystemBindPath — nothing missing, nothing extra, no flag substituted —
// via a symmetric-difference check rather than a one-directional `.every()`.

// `while IFS= read -r`. A mount point legitimately containing a newline
// therefore arrived as TWO records, neither of which is a real path —
// reproduced live in a privileged container before this fix: a single real
// bind mount at `<dir>/a\nb` produced the records `<dir>/a` and `b`, and
// neither exists on disk. In the setup-time remount that is a `mount
// -o remount,ro,bind` against a nonexistent path; in the post-pivot verifier
// it is the false-success shape this verification exists to prevent, because
// `probe_ro` against a nonexistent path prints nothing, which the verifier
// reads as "this submount is confirmed read-only" while it is still writable.
//
// The fix inverts what crosses the newline channel: RAW (still-escaped)
// mountinfo records only — which the kernel guarantees are newline-free —
// with the decode happening inside the consuming loop and the decoded path
// handed to `mount`/`probe_ro` as a DIRECT argv entry.
