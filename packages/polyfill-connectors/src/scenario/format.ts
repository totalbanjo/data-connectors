 * - the connector id in the scenario must match the connector being verified.
 * validate.ts validates SHAPE only for digests — it does not compare them
 * against the current tree. Digest COMPARISON is bin/scenario-verify.ts's
 * job: by default it REPORTS `captured_with` vs. the current subject's
 * digests (differing is expected and fine — that is what lets a scenario
 * serve as a refactor oracle); `--require-capture-source` restores strict
 * equality for exact-artifact reproduction. See `ScenarioCapturedWith`'s doc

 * expired by replay time is a property of the SPECIFIC PROVIDER's OTP
 * implementation, not something this harness can verify generically — a
 * long-lived or reusable "OTP" from a nonstandard provider would have made
 * the old unconditional default an actual secret leak). `--persist-otp` asks
 * the caller to explicitly assert that single-use/expired semantics for the
 * provider being captured, printing a one-line justification requirement
 * when passed. When persisted, `response.value`/`response.data` holds the
 * code exactly as the developer entered it, replayed verbatim by
 * `scenario-verify`. Scenarios are local-only (`ScenarioCapture.privacy_class`)
 * and MUST NOT be committed or shared without a scrub pass regardless of
 * this flag.
 *
 * `kind: "credentials"` prompts are NEVER persisted, unconditionally — no
 * flag opts a credentials response into verbatim retention.
 * scenario-record stores only `{status, redacted: true}` for a credentials
 * response — no `value`/`data`, since a credentials prompt is exactly the
 * kind of long-lived secret verbatim retention would be unsafe for.
 * `scenario-verify` refuses to replay a `redacted: true` interaction outright
 * (see bin/scenario-verify.ts) — a redacted scenario is not

 *   - SKIP_RESULT ("skip_result"): a stream declared it could not account
 *     for something, plus (repair wave 3B) its optional `continuation` —
 *     SLVP §4.3's runtime-owned "more historical work remains" fact.
 *   - DETAIL_COVERAGE ("detail_coverage"): a stream's considered/covered/
 *     gap accounting for a hydration pass.
 *   - DETAIL_GAP ("detail_gap"): one bounded, retryable per-record gap,
 *     including (repair wave 4) its optional `detail`/`last_error`
 *     `network_pressure` evidence in privacy-safe normalized form.
 *   - DETAIL_GAP_ATTEMPTED ("detail_gap_attempted", repair wave 3B): a
 *     served recovery lease was attempted for a pending gap.
 *   - DETAIL_GAP_RECOVERED ("detail_gap_recovered", repair wave 3B): a
 *     previously-declared gap was honestly recovered.
 *   - DETAIL_GAPS_PAGE_REQUEST ("detail_gaps_page_request", repair wave 4):
 *     the runtime's own request for a page of pending recovery-eligible
 *     gaps — request_id/max_bytes/streams are all runtime- or
 *     connector-declared, no provider content.
 *   - the terminal DONE ("done"): final status, the aggregate
 *     `records_emitted` total (repair wave 4), plus, when present, the
 *     error's code/retryable/recovery fields and (repair wave 6) a digest of
 *     `error.message`.
 * PROGRESS is deliberately excluded — connector-runtime-protocol.ts's own
 * doc comment calls it a diagnostic/operator-legibility channel, not a
 * completeness claim, and RECORD/STATE stay in `ScenarioStreamExpectation`/
 * `final_state` above (this array is additive to that oracle, not a
 * replacement).
 *
 * EXCLUDED-BY-POLICY, NOT BY OVERSIGHT (repair wave 3B; now machine-enforced
 * by `TRACE_POLICY`'s `"unsupported_claim_withheld"` disposition, repair
 * wave 4 P1-2): ASSISTANCE and ASSISTANCE_STATUS
 * (connector-runtime-protocol.ts's `AssistanceRequest`/
 * `AssistanceCompletion`) are NOT tracked here, on the same "diagnostic
 * channel, not a completeness claim" footing as PROGRESS above — but unlike
 * PROGRESS, that is a deliberate SCOPE LIMIT this repair wave is flagging,
 * not a settled design call: assistance is the browser/human-in-the-loop
 * escalation surface (owner_action/progress_posture/attachments), and this
 * offline HTTP-replay oracle has no browser or auth driver to verify against
 * yet. A future browser-driven or auth-driver-driven scenario mode may need
 * to track these; until then, this trace format MUST NOT be read as implying
 * completeness proof for the assistance/escalation message class — a
 * connector could silently drop or fabricate an ASSISTANCE exchange and this
 * oracle would not notice. As of repair wave 4 (FIX 2d), a run that actually
 * OBSERVES one of these kinds no longer passes silently: verify.ts's
 * `observedUnsupportedEvidenceSurface` flags it, and
 * `evaluateClaimEligibility` (claims.ts) withholds the canonical
 * `recorded_replay` claim for that run's scenario, naming the reason.
 *
 * NORMALIZATION — fields deliberately DROPPED before an entry is captured,
 * because they are volatile (differ run-to-run for reasons that have
 * nothing to do with connector correctness) and would make an otherwise
 * byte-identical trace fail a naive equality check:
 *   - any request id (SKIP_RESULT/DETAIL_GAP/DETAIL_COVERAGE carry none on
 *     the wire today, but this rule generalizes if one is ever added);
 *   - `DetailGapNetworkPressure.attempt`/`retry_after_ms`/`safe_headers`
 *     (retry-attempt counters and wall-clock-derived retry hints — the
 *     CLASS of pressure is captured via `error_class`/`endpoint_route`/
 *     `method`/`status`, not the timing of a particular attempt);
 *   - any timestamp (none of these six message shapes carry one directly,
 *     but `RECORD.emitted_at` is the reason this rule is stated explicitly
 *     rather than left implicit — a future field must be evaluated against
 *     this same volatility test before being added to a trace entry);
 *   - request/response durations (not present on any of these six shapes
 *     today, called out for the same reason as timestamps above).
 * Everything else — reason/kind/stream identity, record/gap keys, gap
 * counts, DONE's status/error code/retryable/recovery_hint — is
 * completeness-bearing and kept verbatim.
 *
 * FIELD DISPOSITION TABLE (repair wave 3B, P1-3; extended repair wave 4,
 * P1-2 for `network_pressure`, `detail_gaps_page_request`, and DONE's

 * gets one of three dispositions, chosen from the REAL wire shape in
 * connector-runtime-protocol.ts, not guessed:
 *
 *   compared-directly — kept verbatim, byte-for-byte, in the trace entry.
 *     Reserved for values that are either (a) fixed protocol literals with
 *     no provider content (`retryable: true`, `status: "pending"`,
 *     `reference_only: true`), or (b) connector-declared/deterministic
 *     accounting numbers or boundary tokens that carry no raw provider
 *     payload (`considered`/`covered`/`boundary`/`slice_start`/`slice_end`/
 *     `records_emitted` — see below).
 *   digested — replaced with a PRESENCE flag plus a full sha256 (hex) of the
 *     canonical-JSON value (see `digestTraceValue` in verify.ts). Reserved
 *     for values that are opaque, provider-issued, or provider-shaped and

 *     provider's own message/thread id; a list_cursor is an opaque provider
 *     pagination token; a detail_locator can carry arbitrary provider-shaped
 *     lookup fields; `network_pressure.endpoint_route` is a request PATH that

 *
 * SCOPE — DATA MAPPING, NOT CHOREOGRAPHY (read this before treating a
 * `recorded-browser` PASS as equivalent to `recorded-http`'s): this driver
 * replays NETWORK TRAFFIC (`routeFromHAR`) into the connector's own browser
 * context, then proves the connector's DATA MAPPING — recorded responses to
 * emitted RECORDs — the exact same way `recorded-http` proves it for fetch
 * traffic. It does NOT replay or verify page choreography (clicks,
 * navigation timing, DOM state machines): anti-bot JS and timer
 * nondeterminism make click/navigation sequences non-deterministically
 * replayable across two separate browser runs, even against the identical
 * HAR. `claims.ts`/`wire-registry.ts` reflect this: `recorded-browser` can
 * never earn the canonical `recorded_replay` claim (see
 * `everyRunDeclaresRecordedHttpDriver` in claims.ts, which checks the
 * literal `"recorded-http"` and therefore always excludes this driver) —
 * only the weaker `diagnostic_replay: PASS` with named limitations,
 * including an explicit staleness disclaimer tying the claim to the HAR's
 * capture timestamp (never to "the live provider still works this way").
 *
 * NOT CAPTURED/REPLAYED BY THIS DRIVER — explicit, not a silent gap:
 * WebSocket/EventSource/SSE traffic (`recordHar`/`routeFromHAR` do not
 * capture or replay WebSocket frames at all — Playwright's HAR machinery is
 * HTTP-request/response only) and browser download events (a download's
 * body can bypass route interception entirely). Zero of this package's
 * connectors use either surface as of this driver's introduction, so this
 * is a documented boundary, not a defect discovered by a failing scenario —
 * see `browser-har-replay.ts`'s module doc for the same note co-located
