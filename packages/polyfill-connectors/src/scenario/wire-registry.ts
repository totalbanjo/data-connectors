 *
 * GROUNDING THE `stream` RULE (eighth review, P2): the wire TYPE declares
 * `stream: string` with no "nonempty" annotation in its own doc comment
 * (unlike RECORD's `key`, whose doc comment explicitly says "A scalar
 * `number` is never valid on the wire") — so this validator's nonempty-string
 * rule for `stream` is not copied from an explicit protocol annotation, it is
 * grounded in EVERY REAL EMISSION SITE this repo has: every connector that
 * emits STATE (connectors/github/index.ts, connectors/imessage/index.ts,
 * connectors/jellyfin/index.ts, connectors/ynab/index.ts,
 * connectors/steam/index.ts, and others) always supplies a nonempty literal
 * stream name (`"user"`, `"accounts"`, `"libraries"`, ...) — none emits
 * `stream: ""`, and a cursor with no stream to attach to cannot be merged
 * into `final_state` by `mergeStateMessages` (verify.ts) or
 * `messagesToRecordsAndState` (subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts) in any
 * meaningful way (`base[""] = cursor` would silently create a
 * `""`-keyed state entry no scenario expectation could ever reference by
 * name). This mirrors RECORD's already-enforced `stream` rule exactly
 * (`assertValidRecordMessage` above) rather than inventing a laxer rule for
 * STATE — the runtime's ACTUAL behavior for both message kinds is "every
 * real emission names a real, nonempty stream", so this validator states
 * that honestly instead of accepting a shape the runtime never produces.
 *
 * `cursor` is intentionally checked for PRESENCE only (the property must
 * exist on the parsed object), never for shape — `cursor: unknown` on the
 * wire type is a deliberate opacity: a cursor is connector-owned and
 * arbitrarily shaped (a string token, a number, an object, even `null`), so
 * this validator must not reject a legitimate cursor value for "looking
 * wrong". What it DOES reject is the property being entirely ABSENT — a
 * STATE message that never carried a `cursor` key at all is not "cursor:
 * null" (a connector deliberately clearing its cursor), it is a malformed
 * message missing a required field, and `Object.hasOwn` distinguishes the
 * two cases (`{stream:"x"}` has no `cursor` key; `{stream:"x",cursor:null}`
 * does).

/**
 * The generic driver-evidence prerequisite for the canonical `recorded_replay`
 * claim (repair wave 6, P1-1): a driver's own minimum bar for "this run
 * actually exercised its transport", independent of and additional to
 * `evaluateClaimEligibility`'s other seven conditions (identity binding,
 * digest bindings, environment-driver declaration, protocol-trace presence,
 * namespace isolation, unsupported-evidence-surface). A scenario can declare
 * `environment.network.driver === "recorded-http"` on every run (condition
 * (d), already checked) while still never having recorded a single real HTTP
 * interaction — e.g. every run's `interactions` array is empty because the
 * connector only emitted STATE/DONE, or a scenario file was hand-assembled
 * rather than genuinely captured. Declaring the driver is not the same as
 * having evidence FOR that driver; this map closes that gap per-driver.
 *
 * Structured as a small map (not an `if driver === "recorded-http"`
 * special-case inline in `evaluateClaimEligibility` or `scenario-verify.ts`)
 * so a future driver (browser/imap/subprocess) adds its own entry here —
 * its own minimum-evidence predicate over the scenario — without touching
 * the recorded-http entry or claims.ts's evaluator logic at all.
 *
 * `recorded-http`'s policy (the only driver this build implements —
 * `bin/scenario-verify.ts`'s `SUPPORTED_NETWORK_DRIVER`): satisfied only
 * when the scenario has at least one recorded HTTP interaction across ITS
 * RUNS — `scenario.runs.some((run) => run.interactions.length > 0)`.
 * Consumption of a recorded interaction (every recorded interaction actually
 * being replayed, none left over) is already enforced elsewhere and is
 * DELIBERATELY NOT duplicated here: `replay.ts`'s `ReplayFetch.
 * assertAllConsumed()`, called from `verify.ts`'s `verifyRun` for every run,
 * already fails the run (`unconsumed_interactions` `VerifyFailure`) when any
 * recorded interaction was never consumed by the replay. This policy answers
 * a narrower, prerequisite question — "did this scenario capture any
 * recorded-http evidence AT ALL" — which `assertAllConsumed()` cannot answer
 * on its own (a scenario with zero interactions trivially has zero
 * unconsumed ones too, so it would pass that check vacuously).
