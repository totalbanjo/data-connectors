 * Descendant network isolation for the scenario-record/scenario-verify
 * subprocess boundary.
 *
 * PROBLEM THIS CLOSES: `subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts`'s replay preload denies
 * egress at the JS layer (patched `fetch`/`http`/`https`/`net.Socket.prototype.connect`
 * inside the connector's OWN process — see that module's docstring). That
 * preload explicitly documents a gap it does not close: a connector that
 * shells out to `child_process` (a `curl` invocation, a helper `node`
 * process with its own network stack, a browser child Playwright/Patchright
 * launches) is NOT intercepted, because the preload only patches bindings
 * inside the process it's loaded into — a spawned descendant gets a fresh,
 * unpatched network stack. This module closes that gap at the OS layer
 * instead of the JS layer: it puts the connector subprocess (and therefore
 * every descendant it spawns, transitively) into a Linux network namespace
 * with no interfaces except loopback, so `curl`, a child `node`, a spawned
 * browser, etc. all physically have nowhere to send a non-loopback packet.
 *
 * MECHANISM: `unshare --map-root-user --net --mount --pid --ipc --uts --fork
 * -- sh -c '<bring up lo>; <filesystem closure — see PATHNAME-UDS ESCAPE
 * below>; exec <cmd> <args>'`. `--net` creates a new, empty network namespace
 * (only a down `lo` interface exists in a fresh netns); `--map-root-user`
 * also unshares a user namespace and maps the caller to root *inside* it,
 * which is what makes `--net` usable WITHOUT the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`/root the
 * bare `--net` flag would otherwise require on the host — an unprivileged
 * user can create a user+net namespace pair and hold real capabilities (incl.
 * `CAP_NET_ADMIN`) only inside it. `--mount` gives the child its own mount
 * namespace (needed for the filesystem closure below) and `--pid --fork`
 * gives it its own pid namespace (needed for that closure's post-pivot
 * `mount -t proc proc /proc`, which an unprivileged mount namespace without
 * its own pid namespace cannot perform — see `filesystemClosureShellPrelude`'s
 * doc comment). `--ipc` unshares the SysV IPC namespace (shared memory,
 * semaphores, message queues) — without it, `/proc/sysvipc/shm` and friends
 * enumerate every live host IPC object's key/owner/perms from inside the
 * isolated child, the same class of host reconnaissance `--unshare-pid`
 * closes for `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`; composes cleanly with the other unshared
 * namespaces, no observed cost. `--uts` unshares the hostname/domainname
 * namespace — hostname disclosure isn't treated as sensitive by this
 * module's threat model, but the flag is free (no functional cost observed),
 * so it's unshared anyway rather than left as a documented exception. The
 * `sh -c` prelude brings `lo` up (`ip link set lo up`)
 * before anything else, because a fresh netns's loopback starts DOWN —
 * without this, 127.0.0.1 traffic (the replay bridge, if reached via TCP
 * loopback) would fail too, not just external egress; it runs before the
 * filesystem closure specifically so `ip` still resolves through the
 * original, unmodified root. `exec` (not a plain subshell call) replaces
 * the shell with the target process so signals/exit codes propagate
 * normally and there's no lingering `sh` in the process tree.
 *
 * WHY THE BRIDGE NEEDS A UNIX DOMAIN SOCKET: a fresh network namespace's
 * loopback is its OWN loopback, disjoint from the parent namespace's
 * 127.0.0.1 — a TCP server the parent process binds on 127.0.0.1 is NOT
 * reachable from inside the child's netns (they are different loopback
 * devices in different namespaces; that is the entire point of `--net`).
 * A Unix domain socket bound to a path in the shared filesystem crosses
 * that boundary fine, because netns isolation is a network-stack property,
 * not a filesystem property — a UDS is just a special file `connect()`
 * opens, no IP routing involved. So the replay bridge must additionally
 * support a UDS transport (see `writeReplayBridgePreload`'s `udsPath`
 * option and `startFetchBridgeServer`'s `listen` argument in
 * subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts) whenever the connector subprocess this
 * module spawns is namespace-isolated; the existing TCP-loopback bridge
 * mode remains the only option (and the only one that could ever work) when
 * isolation is unavailable and the connector runs in the parent's own netns.
 *
 * PATHNAME-UDS ESCAPE — TWO REVIEW PASSES, TWO DIFFERENT REPAIRS:
 *
 * Pass 1 (external review) found that `--net`/`--unshare-net` only
 * constrains the network namespace, never the filesystem: a prior version
 * of this module left the isolated child's filesystem view IDENTICAL to the
 * parent's (`--dev-bind / /` for bwrap; plain `unshare --net` inherits the
 * parent's existing mount namespace unchanged), so a NATIVE descendant
 * (`curl --unix-socket <path>`, not routed through this package's JS
 * `fetch`/`http`/`net` patching at all) could dial ANY pathname UDS
 * reachable on the shared filesystem — reported repro: `unshare -r -n --
 * curl --unix-socket /tmp/foreign.sock http://localhost/probe`. The first
 * repair (kept in git history, no longer present in this file) masked a
 * hand-picked list of "conventional world-writable temp directories"
 * (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, `/dev/shm`, `os.tmpdir()`) plus, after a second
 * review round, `/run`.
 *
 * Pass 2 (independent second review) proved that repair architecturally
 * cannot terminate: `--dev-bind / /` still stood, so the reachable set was
 * "every path on the host that is not on the mask list" — and the list can
 * only ever be finitely long while the escape it targets (any world-
 * readable/writable path a foreign process might have put a socket under)
 * is unbounded. `/run` was the SECOND directory found reachable this way,
 * not the last: the reviewer went on to reach the REAL ssh-agent socket
 * (under `$HOME/.ssh/agent/`, not `/run/user/<uid>` — an entirely different
 * path the mask list never had, and never could enumerate in advance,
 * because it depends on the CALLER's environment, not this module's code),
 * the D-Bus session bus, a Bitwarden vault socket, browser native-messaging
 * sockets, and the codex-approval-host control socket — 24 live sockets in
 * total, none of them under any masked directory.
 *
 * `bwrapFilesystemClosureArgs`/`filesystemClosureShellPrelude` below replace
 * mask-listing with DEFAULT-DENY:
 * instead of starting from `--dev-bind / /` (everything visible) and
 * subtracting a list of directories to hide, the isolated child's root is
 * built from an empty `--tmpfs /` (nothing visible) and only the finite,
 * named set of real paths this replay subprocess actually needs is bound
 * back in, at its real location. That set is DERIVED — see
 * `requiredFilesystemBinds()` below — from what this package's own spawn
 * call, install script, and Node/pnpm layout declare as dependencies
 * (the Node binary's own resolved path, `REPO_ROOT` which holds
 * `node_modules`/tsx/every connector's source, Patchright's browser-binary
 * cache directory, and the handful of standard OS directories dynamic
 * linking and TLS need), not guessed or hand-curated independently of the
 * code that actually requires them. A foreign UDS under `$HOME/.ssh/agent`,
 * `/run/user/<uid>`, a Bitwarden vault directory, or literally any other
 * path NOT in that derived set is unreachable, because nothing outside the
 * set exists in the isolated child's filesystem view at all — closing the
 * escape CLASS, not one more instance of it. A path missing from the
 * derived set fails LOUDLY (the connector's own `require`/`import`/spawn
 * fails with ENOENT against a real, diagnosable path) rather than silently
 * widening the sandbox — the opposite failure direction from a mask list,
 * where a missed entry fails open and invisibly.
 *
 * REMAINING GAP, RECONCILED (P1, external review of ab415be6c): default-deny
 * closes reachability for a FOREIGN path outside the derived set, but a `ro`
 * bind (the derived set's own entries, including `REPO_ROOT`) only blocks
 * WRITES — a socket file that ALREADY EXISTS somewhere under `REPO_ROOT` (or
 * any other `ro` bind) at spawn time stays dialable, `connect()` needing no
 * write permission. Recursive read-only (`recursiveReadOnlyRemountCommand`)
 * closes the ability to CREATE a new one during a run, turning this into a
 * finite, checkable precondition rather than an open-ended exception:
 * `findPreexistingSocketsUnderReadOnlyBinds()` scans for exactly this
 * before every spawn, and `bin/scenario-verify.ts` withholds
 * `recorded_replay` — naming the exact path — whenever the scan finds one.
 * See that function's own doc comment for the full mechanism.
 *
 * CAPABILITY DETECTION: unprivileged user-namespace creation is not
 * guaranteed available. It can be disabled at the kernel level
 * (`kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0`, some hardened distros/containers)
 * or blocked by an LSM policy even when the sysctl allows it (observed
 * empirically in this development sandbox: `unprivileged_userns_clone=1`
 * but AppArmor's `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1` still
 * rejects `unshare --map-root-user --net`, with `write failed
 * /proc/self/uid_map: Operation not permitted`). `isNamespaceIsolationAvailable()`
 * does not infer this from sysctls — it actually test-spawns the FULL
 * `unshare` namespace+procfs-mount sequence production uses (not just a bare
 * `unshare -r -n true`) and reports what really happened, so callers get a
 * true answer regardless of which of the many ways isolation can be
 * unavailable applies on a given host. This distinction matters: an
 * independent review found a real host shape (Docker `--cap-add=SYS_ADMIN`
 * without full `--privileged`, so Docker's default procfs-subpath masking
 * stays active) where namespace CREATION succeeds but the PID-namespace's
 * own `mount -t proc proc /proc` is refused by the kernel's "too revealing"
 * check — a bare `unshare -r -n true` probe cannot see this coming, because
 * it never attempts the mount. `probeUnshare()` runs the mount-and-verify
 * sequence itself (`procMountVerifyStatements()`) so this failure is caught
 * at probe time (`available: false`, with the kernel's own refusal message
 * in `reason`) rather than surfacing later as a silently empty `/proc` in a
 * spawn that reports success. `filesystemClosureShellPrelude` independently
 * re-checks the same condition at spawn time and refuses to `exec` the
 * target command if it fails, as a second gate for a caller that bypasses
 * the probe.
 *
 * WHAT THIS BOUNDARY DOES AND DOES NOT ISOLATE (both mechanisms, unless
 * noted): isolated — network (no egress beyond loopback), PID (no foreign
 * host process enumeration or `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` read, no `kill(pid, 0)`
 * reachability), mount/filesystem (default-deny: only the derived allowlist
 * plus `filesystemBindPath` are visible, closing pathname-UDS dials to any
 * FOREIGN socket outside that set — see PATHNAME-UDS ESCAPE above — AND,
 * recursively, every submount under a `ro` bind, not just its top mount —
 * see `recursiveReadOnlyRemountCommand`; a pre-existing socket already
 * inside a `ro` bind at spawn time is a separate, RECONCILED case, checked
 * per-run by `findPreexistingSocketsUnderReadOnlyBinds()`, not something
 * this static filesystem view alone closes), SysV IPC
 * (no `/proc/sysvipc/*` enumeration of host shared memory/semaphores/message
 * queues), UTS (hostname/domainname). Deliberately NOT isolated, by
 * conscious scope decision rather than oversight: the CGROUP namespace (an
 * isolated child's own `/proc/self/cgroup` still reflects the HOST's real
 * cgroup hierarchy path — narrow information disclosure of container/session
 * naming conventions and resource-group structure, not a credential or
 * process-content leak) and the TIME namespace (`CLOCK_MONOTONIC`/
 * `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` offsets are shared with the host — negligible risk, no
 * credential-adjacent exploitation path in this module's threat model, no
 * more dangerous than the already-unrestricted ability to read `date`).
 * Neither gap is treated as in-scope by this module's threat model (which is
 * about closing OS-layer network/filesystem/process-visibility escapes a
 * compromised connector could otherwise exploit, not about hiding every
 * possible fact about the host), but a reader should not assume "isolated"
 * covers either of these two namespaces just because the others are covered.
 *
 * WIRED IN: `bin/scenario-verify.ts` calls `isNamespaceIsolationAvailable()`
 * once up front and threads the resolved mechanism through every
 * `spawnWithNetworkIsolation` call for that run (see its
 * `resolveIsolationMechanism` helper) — see USAGE below for the exact shape
 * a caller must follow.
 *
 * USAGE:
 *
 *   import { isNamespaceIsolationAvailable, spawnWithNetworkIsolation } from "./isolation.ts";
 *
 *   const capability = isNamespaceIsolationAvailable();
 *   if (!capability.available) {
 *     console.error(`network isolation: process-local only (${capability.reason})`);
 *   }
 *   const child = spawnWithNetworkIsolation(process.execPath, ["--import", "tsx", connectorPath], {
 *     cwd: PACKAGE_ROOT,
 *     env: { ...subprocessEnv(), NODE_OPTIONS: `--import ${preloadPath}` },
 *     stdio: ["pipe", "pipe", "pipe"],
 *     // Pass the ALREADY-RESOLVED mechanism, never a bare boolean — passing
 *     // `capability.available` (a boolean) here would make `isolate: true`
 *     // re-run the ENTIRE capability probe (spawning `unshare`, and — if
 *     // denied — `bwrap`) from scratch on every single spawn, contradicting
 *     // the "probe once up front, reuse for every run" contract this
 *     // module's capability-detection section documents. `false` when
 *     // isolation isn't available skips wrapping entirely, same as before.
 *     isolate: capability.available ? capability.mechanism : false,
 *     // Re-exposes ONLY this run's own evidence-workspace directory (its

 * TRUSTED LAUNCHER RESOLUTION (P1, external review of ab415be6c) — resolves
 * the `unshare`/`bwrap` binary this module actually spawns to ONE fixed,
 * absolute path, found by walking `TRUSTED_LAUNCHER_DIRECTORIES` in order,
 * rather than letting `node:child_process`'s `spawn`/`spawnSync` resolve a
 * bare command NAME through the calling process's own inherited `$PATH`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CLOSES: before this fix, `probeUnshare()`/`probeBwrap()` (the
 * CAPABILITY CHECK) and `spawnWithNetworkIsolation` (the REAL EXECUTION)
 * both called `spawnSync("unshare", ...)`/`spawn("bwrap", ...)` — a bare
 * command name. Node resolves a bare command name by searching the
 * CALLING PROCESS's own `PATH` environment variable, entry by entry, and
 * uses the FIRST match — exactly the same "attacker prepends a directory
 * ahead of the real one" shape `TRUSTED_SETUP_PATH` already closes for the
 * commands INSIDE the isolated child's own setup script (`mount`,
 * `pivot_root`, ...), but that fix never touched the launcher itself: a
 * caller (or a compromised connector's own environment mutation, since this
 * package's own subprocess env construction is caller-controlled) could
 * still prepend a directory containing a same-named `unshare` or `bwrap` to
 * `process.env.PATH` before this module ran, and that fake binary — not the
 * real, trusted one — is what actually got spawned with this process's own
 * privileges. Both the capability PROBE and the real EXECUTION resolved the
 * bare name independently, so a caller could even see a probe report
 * `available: true` against the REAL binary, then have the real spawn moments
 * later silently run the FAKE one instead (or vice versa) if `PATH` changed
 * in between — this fix removes that gap entirely by resolving once, from a
 * `PATH`-independent source of truth, and threading the SAME resolved
 * absolute path through both call sites.
 *
 * RESOLUTION: walks `TRUSTED_LAUNCHER_DIRECTORIES` in the FIXED order given
 * — never the caller's `$PATH`, never any other environment-derived list —
 * and returns the first `${dir}/${name}` that exists and is executable
 * (`X_OK`). A symlink at that path (e.g. a merged-usr host's `/bin/unshare`
 * pointing into `/usr/bin/unshare`, or vice versa) is followed to its real
 * target via `realpathSync` before being returned, so the value callers spawn
 * is always a concrete file, not a path whose target could be swapped out
 * from under a cached lookup by re-pointing a symlink. Throws (fails closed,
 * never silently falls back to a bare, PATH-resolved name) when NO trusted
 * directory has the binary — a host missing `unshare`/`bwrap` entirely from
 * every trusted location cannot isolate, and this module must say so loudly
 * rather than let `spawn` fall through to an unaudited `$PATH` lookup as an
 * implicit fallback.
 *
 * CACHED per (name), computed once per process — the trusted directories are
 * fixed, real filesystem locations, not expected to change during a single
 * run, and this resolution runs on every probe and every isolated spawn, so
 * memoizing avoids repeating four `existsSync`+`accessSync` checks (up to
 * eight, across both binaries) on every single replay run in a scenario with
 * many runs.
 *
 * `"sh"` (P1-1, external review of ced8300be) — a THIRD name resolved through
 * this exact allowlist, for exactly the same reason as `unshare`/`bwrap`
 * themselves. WHAT THIS CLOSES: before this fix, both `unshareProcMountProbeArgv()`
 * (the probe) and `spawnWithNetworkIsolation`'s `unshare` branch (the real
 * execution) passed the bare string `"sh"` as an argv entry to the already-
 * trusted, absolute-path `unshare` binary — `unshare --map-root-user --net
 * ... -- sh -c <script>`. `unshare` itself then `execvp("sh", ...)`s that
 * argv entry, and `execvp` on a bare name (no `/`) resolves it through the
 * PATH environment variable of the process performing the exec — which, at
 * that moment, is whatever `PATH` this Node process's `spawn()` call handed
 * to the `unshare` child (this package's own subprocess-env construction,
 * fully caller-controlled), NOT `TRUSTED_SETUP_PATH`. `TRUSTED_SETUP_PATH` is
 * assigned as the FIRST STATEMENT INSIDE the shell script that bare `sh` is
 * asked to interpret — so it can only take effect once a trustworthy `sh` is
 * already running it; it does nothing to select WHICH `sh` runs it in the
 * first place. Confirmed empirically in a privileged test container: with
 * `/tmp/fakebin` (holding a fake `sh` that touches a marker file and execs
 * the real `/bin/sh`) prepended to `PATH`, `unshare --map-root-user --net
 * --mount --pid --ipc --uts --fork -- sh -c 'echo hi'` ran the FAKE `sh`
 * first (marker file present) — the exact "PATH-prepended fake sh satisfies
 * the probe sentinel, or replaces the real closure script's interpreter at
 * execution time" attack the review describes, closed by passing
 * `resolveTrustedLauncherPath("sh")`'s absolute result (e.g. `/bin/sh`) as
 * the argv entry instead of the bare string `"sh"` — same empirical test with
 * the absolute path in place: fake `sh` never runs, marker absent. Applied at
 * all three call sites that build a `sh -c` argv for a launcher to exec:
 * `unshareProcMountProbeArgv()` (the probe), `bwrapArgvForFilesystemClosure()`
 * (bwrap's own inner `sh -c` — lower risk in isolation, since it runs inside
 * bwrap's already-closed filesystem view where only `requiredFilesystemBinds()`
 * entries are visible, but the review's fix applies to "both the probe and
 * execution" without carving out bwrap, and the same PATH-inheritance
 * mechanism applies identically to bwrap's own child-argv exec), and

 *   spawns `process.execPath ["--import", "tsx", connectorPath]` with `cwd:
 *   PACKAGE_ROOT` — `tsx`, every connector's source, and the ENTIRE
 *   `node_modules` tree (confirmed: this repo's pnpm store resolves fully
 *   inside `REPO_ROOT`, no external symlink targets) live under the repo
 *   checkout. Read-only: a connector replay has no legitimate reason to
 *   mutate its own source, another connector's source, `node_modules`, or
 *   `.git` — see `FilesystemBind`'s doc comment for the review finding this
 *   closes. Any scratch/cache state a dependency needs at runtime goes under
 *   the sandbox-local writable scratch space instead — see
 *   `SANDBOX_SCRATCH_SUBDIRS` and `sandboxScratchEnv()` below — never under
 *   `REPO_ROOT`.
 * - The directory containing `process.execPath` (ro): the actual Node
 *   binary the child re-execs as. Derived from `process.execPath` itself,
 *   not hardcoded to a distro path, because this repo's Node is a
 *   version-manager install (e.g. under `~/.local/share/mise/...`), not
 *   `/usr/bin/node` — hardcoding a "standard" location would silently break
 *   on exactly this kind of setup, which is the failure mode default-deny
 *   exists to convert from silent to loud.
 * - The Playwright/Patchright browser-binary cache (ro), when it exists:
 *   `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`, if set in this process's own environment, is
 *   read and honored — Playwright/Patchright itself resolves browser
 *   binaries relative to that override when present (confirmed via
 *   Playwright's own resolution order), so a caller running with a
 *   non-default browser path gets that path bound, not silently ignored in
 *   favor of the default. Absent an override, this falls back to
 *   `~/.cache/ms-playwright` (`browser-har-replay.ts`'s
 *   `import("patchright")` path resolves Chromium/Firefox/WebKit binaries
 *   here by default, outside `REPO_ROOT` — confirmed via this package's own
 *   `scripts/install-patchright-browser.ts`, which downloads into exactly
 *   this location absent the env override). Optional (bind-if-present)
 *   because a `recorded-http`-only run never launches a browser and the
 *   directory may not exist in that environment (e.g. a minimal CI image) —
 *   that absence is not a defect in THIS fix. If `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`
 *   IS set but the directory it names does not exist, nothing is bound for
 *   it — a run that then launches a browser fails loudly with ENOENT against
 *   the real configured path, not a silent fallback to the wrong cache.
 * - `/usr` (ro): dynamic linking (`ld-linux`, `libc`, `libcurl`, etc. — every
 *   entry `ldd node` / `ldd curl` reports on this host resolves under
 *   `/usr/lib*`) and every binary this module's own inner command can name
 *   (`node`, `curl`, `sh`).
 * - `/etc` (ro), bound WHOLE, not a narrow subset: `/etc/ssl` (TLS trust
 *   roots), `nsswitch.conf`/`passwd`/`group` (glibc NSS resolution),
 *   `os-release`, and `ld.so.cache`/`ld.so.preload` are all confirmed
 *   touched by `node`/`curl` alone (via `strace -e trace=openat`); a
 *   Playwright-launched browser reads substantially more of `/etc`
 *   (fontconfig, D-Bus machine-id, locale data, its own crypto/cert config)
 *   that varies by distro and browser engine. Binding a curated subset risked
 *   silently under-provisioning that browser surface on some future host;
 *   the whole directory is bound instead and left readable — no new
 *   privilege, since DAC still applies (the isolated child runs as the same
 *   real UID as the parent, confirmed: `--map-root-user`/`--unshare-pid`
 *   only remap namespaces, not the underlying UID `/etc/shadow`-class files
 *   are already protected by on this host).
 * - `/proc`, `/dev` (bwrap's own `--proc`/`--dev`, not a bind of the host's):
 *   every process needs `/proc/self`, `/dev/null`, `/dev/urandom`, etc. to
 *   function as a process at all; bwrap synthesizes fresh, namespace-private
 *   instances of both rather than exposing the host's.
 *
 * `filesystemBindPath` (the caller's own evidence workspace / UDS bridge
 * socket) is NOT part of this derived list — it is a per-call, per-run
 * argument threaded through separately by `spawnWithNetworkIsolation`,
 * exactly as before. `/bin`, `/lib`, `/lib64`, `/lib32`, `/libx32`, `/sbin`
 * are NOT bind-mounted here at all — see `requiredFhsCompatSymlinks()`
 * below: on a merged-usr layout (this host, and every current major distro)
 * they are top-level SYMLINKS into `/usr/...`, not separate directories,
 * and binding `/usr` does not recreate a symlink that has to exist AT THAT
 * TOP-LEVEL PATH for `execvp`/the ELF loader to find it — confirmed
 * empirically: `--ro-bind /usr /usr` alone produces `bwrap: execvp
 * /usr/bin/dash: No such file or directory`, because dash's own ELF
 * interpreter is `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`, an absolute path that does
 * not exist in a root where only `/usr` was bound.
 *
 * A path that does not exist on this host is silently omitted only when
 * explicitly documented above as optional (`~/.cache/ms-playwright`).
 * Every other entry is REQUIRED: `spawnWithNetworkIsolation` does not probe
 * for `REPO_ROOT`/`process.execPath`'s directory/`/usr`/`/etc` existing —
 * their absence would mean Node itself could not have started, so failure
 * there surfaces as bwrap's own loud, diagnostic bind error, never a silent
 * widening of the sandbox.

 * PRE-EXISTING-SOCKET SCAN — reconciles the repository-UDS exception (P1,
 * external review of ab415be6c). Recursive read-only (see
 * `recursiveReadOnlyRemountCommand`) closes writes into any `ro` bind's
 * submounts, but a `ro` bind only blocks WRITES, not reads/dials: a Unix
 * domain socket file that ALREADY EXISTS somewhere under a `ro` bind at
 * spawn time (most concretely, anywhere under `REPO_ROOT`) stays perfectly
 * DIALABLE from inside the isolated child — `connect()` to an existing UDS
 * needs no write permission on the socket or its containing directory,
 * confirmed empirically (a `curl --unix-socket` against a real
 * `REPO_ROOT`-internal socket succeeds even with both the trusted-launcher
 * and recursive-ro fixes applied). Recursive read-only genuinely closes the
 * other half of this FROM INSIDE THE SANDBOX: an isolated CONNECTOR cannot
 * CREATE a new socket anywhere under a `ro` bind once every submount is
 * genuinely read-only.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCAN DOES NOT CLOSE — CORRECTED CLAIM (P1-2, external review of
 * ced8300be): an earlier version of this doc comment claimed "nothing new
 * can appear under a ro bind while replay runs." That OVERSTATES what
 * recursive read-only actually proves: a `ro` bind stops the SANDBOX (the
 * isolated child itself) from creating a new socket there — it says nothing
 * about the HOST. A ro BIND is a property of the isolated child's OWN mount
 * namespace; the SOURCE directory it was bound from (e.g. the real
 * `REPO_ROOT` on disk) remains an ordinary, writable directory to every
 * OTHER process on the same machine that is NOT inside this sandbox — a
 * separate host process (the calling user's own shell, a build script, a
 * completely unrelated program run by the same user) can create a socket
 * under that source directory at any time, and the isolated child would see
 * it appear the moment the host process creates it (a bind mount is a live
 * view of the same inode, not a snapshot — see `filesystemClosureShellPrelude`'s
 * own doc comment on this same property, used there to explain why the
 * SCRATCH directories don't need separate staging). So "the sandbox cannot
 * create a socket here" is proven; "no socket can appear here during this
 * run" is not — the true claim is narrower, and this scan's own TOCTOU
 * narrowing (running it AGAIN, in-namespace, at two later points — see
 * `inNamespaceSocketScanStatement`) exists specifically because this
 * function alone, run once from the host before any run starts, cannot make
 * the broader claim honest.
 *
 * That turns what was an open-ended "the closure isn't universal inside the
 * repo bind" gap into a FINITE, checkable precondition per scan: enumerate
 * every socket under a `ro` bind at the moment this function runs, and if
 * the scan finds ANY (or cannot fully enumerate a subtree — see
 * `SocketScanResult.complete` below), that specific run cannot honestly
 * claim the OS-isolation boundary is airtight — the finding is fed into the
 * `recorded_replay` eligibility decision (see
 * `bin/scenario-verify.ts`'s `isolationEvidenceBoundaryProven` wiring),
 * withholding the strong claim and naming the exact socket path (or the
 * exact unreadable path), rather than silently accepting an unbounded,
 * undocumented exception forever.
 *
 * BOUNDED, not a mask list: this is the opposite shape from the
 * `worldWritableTempDirs` mask-list architecture this module's own module
 * doc comment explains was proven unable to terminate — that list tried to
 * enumerate every directory a FOREIGN socket might live under, which is
 * unbounded in principle. This scan instead enumerates every socket that
 * ALREADY EXISTS under the module's OWN finite, derived bind set right now,
 * a concrete, checkable fact about THIS moment, not a guess about what a
 * foreign process might place somewhere in the future.
 *
 * Does not follow symlinks (`Dirent.isSymbolicLink()` entries are skipped
 * entirely, neither descended into nor stat'd as a socket themselves) —
 * matches every other traversal in this module's own filesystem-closure
 * logic, which never follows a symlink outside the bind it was found under,
 * and avoids a symlink cycle turning this bounded scan unbounded.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED ON AN UNREADABLE SUBTREE (P1-2, external review of
 * ced8300be) — an earlier version caught `readdirSync`'s `EACCES` and simply
 * `return`ed from that subtree, silently treating "I could not see in here"
 * as "nothing here": a fail-OPEN default given this scan's entire purpose is
 * to justify a strong claim. Confirmed empirically, as an unprivileged user:
 * a directory the scanning process cannot LIST — whether `chmod 000`
 * (neither read nor search) or `chmod 311` (search/execute permitted, read
 * permission absent — a directory can be SEARCHED without being LISTABLE,
 * genuinely separate DAC bits) — makes `readdirSync` throw `EACCES`
 * identically in both cases, while a socket with a KNOWN name inside a
 * `311` directory stays fully connectable (confirmed live: a client
 * successfully dialed a socket under a `chmod 311` directory this scan
 * could not enumerate). `SocketScanResult.complete` is `false` whenever ANY
 * subtree could not be fully enumerated, distinct from `sockets` (what was
 * actually found) — a caller must treat `complete: false` as withholding
 * the strong claim exactly like a non-empty `sockets` array, never as
 * "scanned clean."
 *
 * SCOPED TO USER-WRITABLE `ro` BINDS, NOT EVERY `requiredFilesystemBinds()`
 * ENTRY: `/usr` and `/etc` are excluded — confirmed empirically, walking
 * `/usr` alone costs ~700ms (690k entries) on a typical dev host, more than
 * 4x `REPO_ROOT`'s own cost, for a check that cannot find anything real. A
 * socket under `/usr`/`/etc` requires root (or an OS package/container-build
 * step) to plant — this module's own DAC reasoning elsewhere already treats
 * that as outside its threat model ("no new privilege, since DAC still
 * applies... the isolated child runs as the same real UID as the parent" —
 * see `FilesystemBind`'s doc comment), the same way a root-capable attacker
 * could defeat this whole isolation boundary by many other means. `REPO_ROOT`
 * (the repo checkout, writable by the calling user's own build/checkout
 * process — the ACTUAL exception the external review named), `nodeDir` (a
 * per-user version-manager install, e.g. under `~/.local/share/mise/...`),
 * and the Playwright browser cache (also under the user's `$HOME`) are all

 * DEFAULT-DENY FILESYSTEM CLOSURE — replaces the mask-list architecture

 * list," and the reviewer kept finding new members of that set ($HOME/.ssh,
 * a Bitwarden vault socket, the codex-approval control socket — 24 live
 * sockets total) no matter how many directories got masked.
 *
 * MECHANISM (bwrap): `--unshare-pid` gives the child its own PID namespace
 * (composing with the pre-existing `--unshare-net`) — without it, bwrap's
 * `--proc /proc` mounts a FRESH procfs instance that still reflects the
 * HOST's PID namespace (procfs is a view of whichever PID namespace the
 * mounting process belongs to, independent of the mount being "fresh"), so
 * an isolated child could enumerate and read `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` — full
 * argv, which routinely carries secrets (`--token=...`, connection strings)
 * — for every process on the host, not just its own subtree. `--unshare-ipc`
 * closes the symmetric gap for SysV IPC: without it, `/proc/sysvipc/shm`
 * (and semaphores/message queues) enumerate every live host IPC object's
 * key/owner/perms from inside the isolated child, the same reconnaissance
 * shape as the unpatched `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` leak. `--unshare-uts` closes
 * hostname/domainname visibility — not treated as sensitive by this module's
 * threat model, but added because it composes with no observed cost.
 * Confirmed via an independent review's repro: without `--unshare-pid`, an
 * isolated child's `ls /proc | grep -cE '^[0-9]+$'` showed 1683 of 1681 host
 * processes (essentially the entire host process table); with it, the same
 * probe shows only the child's own tiny subtree, matching what `unshare
 * --pid --fork` (below) already did correctly. The child's root is
 * `--tmpfs /` — an empty, private tmpfs, NOT the host's `/` — so nothing
 * exists in the isolated view except what this function explicitly binds
 * back in: `--proc /proc`, `--dev /dev`, every `requiredFilesystemBinds()`
 * entry (`--ro-bind` or `--bind` per its `mode`), and, last,
 * `filesystemBindPath` if the caller passed one.
 * A foreign UDS under `$HOME/.ssh/agent`, `/run/user/<uid>`, or any other
 * path outside that finite set has NO node in the isolated child's mount
 * table to be reached through — `curl --unix-socket <foreign-path>` fails
 * with "No such file or directory" not because that specific path was
 * masked, but because the child's filesystem contains only what was
 * explicitly built, the same way a fresh container image contains only what
 * its Dockerfile added.
 *
 * MECHANISM (unshare): `--mount --pid --fork` (composing with
 * `--map-root-user --net`) gives the child its own mount AND pid namespace,
 * then the `sh -c` prelude this function builds performs an actual
 * `pivot_root` — NOT a `mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /` on the existing root, which
 * was tried first and empirically does NOT work: mounting a tmpfs directly
 * onto the mount namespace's OWN root is a documented Linux special case
 * that silently fails to change what's visible (confirmed: files written
 * after the "masking" mount remained visible alongside pre-existing
 * content — the mount succeeded, exit 0, but never became the root's
 * effective view). The correct, standard technique: build a fresh tmpfs at
 * a STAGING path (e.g. `/tmp/newroot`), bind every `requiredFilesystemBinds()`
 * entry and `filesystemBindPath` (if given) into that staging tree at their
 * real absolute sub-paths, `mount --make-rprivate /` (detach from the
 * parent mount namespace's propagation so the pivot never touches the real
 * host), then `pivot_root <staging> <staging>/oldroot` — this ATOMICALLY
 * swaps the process's root to the staging tree and moves the old root out
 * of the way at `/oldroot`, which is then lazily unmounted
 * (`umount -l /oldroot`) so nothing outside the staged tree remains
 * reachable at all. `mount -t proc proc /proc` MUST run AFTER the pivot
 * (procfs is tied to the calling process's pid namespace, and mounting it
 * pre-pivot at a bind-mounted staging path was empirically denied —
 * `--pid --fork` gives the child a genuine fresh pid namespace so the
 * post-pivot mount is permitted). This produces the SAME filesystem view
 * bwrap's `--tmpfs /` + explicit binds produces — verified empirically:
 * `ls /` post-pivot shows only the bound paths' basenames, a foreign path
 * outside every bind is provably absent (`ENOENT`, not merely masked), and
 * `node -e "..."`/`curl` both run correctly through the FHS-compat symlinks
 * `requiredFhsCompatSymlinks()` recreates the same way bwrap's `--symlink`

 * (staging tmpfs create+mount, oldroot dir creation, every required bind,
 * every ro remount, the caller's workspace bind, device-node creation and

 * `mkdir`/`ln`/`touch`, and a POST-PIVOT VERIFICATION block (see
 * `postPivotVerificationStatements`) proves — not merely assumes — that the
 * new root is active, `/oldroot` is genuinely unreachable, and every
 * declared `ro` bind is genuinely read-only, before `exec` runs.
 *
 * MECHANISM otherwise unchanged from the prior version: `--mount --pid
 * --fork` (composing with `--map-root-user --net`) gives the child its own
 * mount AND pid namespace; the `sh -c` prelude performs an actual
 * `pivot_root` (NOT a `mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /` on the existing root, which
 * was tried first and empirically does not change what's visible — see the
 * git history for that repro) — build a fresh tmpfs at a STAGING path,
 * `--rbind` (RECURSIVE bind — see below for why plain `--bind` is
 * insufficient) every `requiredFilesystemBinds()` entry and
 * `filesystemBindPath` (if given) into that staging tree at their real
 * absolute sub-paths, `mount --make-rprivate /`, then `pivot_root <staging>
 * <staging>/oldroot` — ATOMICALLY swaps the process's root and moves the old
 * root out of the way at `/oldroot`, lazily unmounted afterward so nothing
 * outside the staged tree remains reachable at all.
 *
 * `--rbind`, NOT plain `--bind` (P1-1, ninth review — found while building
 * this fix's own forced-failure negative controls, verified against a real
 * privileged container): a plain `mount --bind /etc <staged>` FAILS outright
 * ("wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock") whenever the source
 * directory itself contains further mount points underneath it — the
 * ordinary case for `/etc` on any container runtime that injects
 * `/etc/resolv.conf`/`/etc/hostname`/`/etc/hosts` as individual bind mounts
 * (confirmed: Docker does this by default; every container this fix was
 * tested against has three such sub-mounts under `/etc`). Under the OLD
 * fail-open prelude this failure was invisible (swallowed by
 * `>/dev/null 2>&1`, and the isolated child then ran with `/etc` either
 * empty or absent inside its new root — a different, also-silent failure
 * mode). `--rbind` recursively carries every sub-mount along with the parent
 * directory, matching what a plain, non-recursive host directory would look
 * like from inside the isolated child, and is a strict superset of what a
 * non-nested source (e.g. `REPO_ROOT`, which has no sub-mounts on any tested
 * host) needs — so it is used uniformly for every entry, not conditionally.
 *
 * RECURSIVE READ-ONLY (P1, external review of ab415be6c): `--rbind` pulls in
 * every submount under a `ro` bind's source directory, but the classic
 * `mount -o remount,ro,bind <staged>` step that follows it ONLY remounts the
 * TOP mount at `<staged>` — Linux does not apply `remount,ro,bind`
 * recursively to the submounts `--rbind` carried along, confirmed
 * empirically: a nested bind mount created under a source directory (e.g.
 * Docker's own `/etc/resolv.conf`-style injected submounts, or any other
 * mount point that happens to exist under a `ro` bind's real path) stays
 * WRITABLE after the parent's remount succeeds and reports `available: true`
 * — the exact false-success shape this hardening closes. See
 * `recursiveReadOnlyRemountCommand` below for the fix: after each `ro`
 * bind's top-level remount, walk `/proc/self/mountinfo` (still readable at
 * this point — it's pre-pivot, so this reads the CURRENT namespace's own
 * view) for every mount point that is a descendant of that bind's staged
 * path, and remount each ONE individually. Wrapped in `req` like every
 * other mandatory step, so a submount that refuses to go read-only halts

 * BYTE-SAFE: NO DECODED PATH EVER CROSSES A NEWLINE CHANNEL (P1-1, external

 * literal newline byte and then `print` the decoded path, one per line, into
 * a pipe its callers consumed with `while IFS= read -r`. A mount point whose
 * name legitimately CONTAINS a newline therefore arrived as TWO records,
 * neither of which is a real path — confirmed live in a privileged container
 * (see this fix's commit message): a single real bind mount at `<dir>/a\nb`
 * produced the two records `<dir>/a` and `b`, and `[ -d ... ]` reports
 * neither exists. In the setup-time remount that turns into a `mount
 * -o remount,ro,bind` against a nonexistent path; in the post-pivot verifier
 * it is worse than that — `probe_ro` against a nonexistent path prints
 * nothing, which the verifier reads as "this submount is confirmed
 * read-only," so a genuinely WRITABLE submount is reported clean. That is the
 * false-success shape this whole verification exists to prevent.
 *
 * THE FIX inverts what the newline channel carries. The RAW mountinfo record
 * is newline-free BY CONSTRUCTION — the kernel escapes a literal newline in a
 * mount point as `\012` precisely so a record occupies exactly one line
 * (`proc(5)`; confirmed live: a real `<dir>/a\nb` mount appears as the single
 * raw field `<dir>/a\012b`). So the line-oriented stage now carries only RAW,
 * still-escaped records — where a newline cannot appear — and the DECODE
 * happens inside the consuming shell loop, after the record boundary has
 * already been established. The decoded path then goes to the caller's
 * command as a direct argv entry (`"$@" "$__decoded"`), never through another
 * pipe, another `echo`, or another line-split. A path containing any byte —
 * newline, tab, space, backslash — survives intact because after decoding it
 * is only ever passed, never re-serialized.
 *
 * DECODING IS NOT IDEMPOTENT, SO IT HAPPENS EXACTLY ONCE. A mount point whose
 * name contains the literal four-character text `\012` escapes to `\134012`
 * (backslash itself escapes to `\134`), which decodes back to the literal
 * text `\012` — NOT to a newline. Confirmed live alongside the newline case
 * above: the two are distinct in the raw field (`a\012b` vs `lit\134012eral`)
 * and only stay distinct if the raw text is decoded exactly once, left to
 * right, with each decoded byte emitted directly rather than rescanned. The
 * decoder below consumes the four input characters of an escape and advances
 * past them, so a `\134` that decodes to a backslash is never re-examined as
 * the start of the following `012` — which is what keeps a mount point
 * literally named `\012` from being mistaken for one containing a newline.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED ENUMERATION (P1-2, external review of 2a134e153). The prior
 * version was `awk ... /proc/self/mountinfo | while read ...; done`: if awk
 * exited nonzero, or `/proc/self/mountinfo` was absent/unreadable, the
 * pipeline still exited 0 having run the loop body zero times — confirmed
 * live, both shapes exit 0 — so "I could not enumerate" was byte-identical to
 * "there are no submounts," and setup proceeded / verification passed. This
 * version STAGES the parser's output to a temporary file and refuses to
 * iterate until it has POSITIVE evidence of a successful parse:
 *
 *   1. the parser's own exit status is 0 (captured directly, not through a
 *      pipeline that discards it), AND
 *   2. the parser reports it actually READ AND PARSED mountinfo — it emits a
 *      trailing `#` sentinel line carrying the number of records it saw, and
 *      that count must be present and nonzero. A zero-record mountinfo is
 *      impossible for a live process (the root mount alone is always there),
 *      so "parsed zero records" is itself proof of a truncated or malformed
 *      read rather than a legitimate empty result.
 *
 * Only when both hold does it iterate; otherwise it exits
 * `SUBMOUNT_ENUMERATION_FAILURE_EXIT_CODE` with a diagnostic. This is what
 * makes an unreadable, absent, empty, malformed, or partially-written
 * mountinfo BLOCK the child rather than silently look clean. Note that
 * "found zero SUBMOUNTS" remains a perfectly legitimate result (most binds
 * have none) and is distinguished from "parsed zero RECORDS" — only the
 * latter is a failure.
 *
 * ORDER: newest mounts appear later in `/proc/self/mountinfo`, so a mount
 * nested two levels deep (a submount of a submount) is naturally processed
 * AFTER its own parent submount, in the same top-to-bottom order the file
 * already lists them — unchanged from the prior version's reasoning, and
 * preserved here because the staging file keeps the parser's original order.

	// sentinel alone would have let the caller iterate on garbage. A real

/**
 * IN-NAMESPACE SOCKET SCAN (P1-2, external review of ced8300be) — the
 * host-side pre-flight scan (`findPreexistingSocketsUnderReadOnlyBinds()`)
 * runs from the CALLING Node process, before any isolated child's mount
 * namespace even exists — it sees the real host filesystem, not the
 * isolated child's own pivoted view, and it runs only ONCE, before ANY
 * run's subprocess spawns. The external review's TOCTOU objection: a HOST
 * process (a separate, non-sandboxed process on the same machine, with
 * ordinary write access to a `ro` bind's SOURCE directory on the real
 * filesystem — recursive read-only only stops the SANDBOX from creating a
 * new socket there, not the host) can create a socket under a scanned path
 * at any point between that one early scan and the target command's actual
 * `exec` — a gap of however long every earlier run in the scenario took.
 * This closes that gap by running the SAME kind of check TWICE more,
 * IN-NAMESPACE: once as part of `postPivotVerificationStatements` (right
 * after every `ro` bind's top-level AND submount remounts have completed —
 * the earliest point at which the isolated child's own view of those paths
 * is both final and read-only), and once again immediately before `exec
 * <target>` in `spawnWithNetworkIsolation`'s unshare branch (the LAST
 * possible point before the target command could dial anything). Narrows
 * the race window on every run to "however long this run's own setup takes
 * between the two scan points," not "however long the whole scenario's
 * prior runs took" — genuinely smaller, but NOT zero: a host process could
 * still plant a socket in the interval between this function's second call
 * and the target's first `connect()`, however short. See this function's
 * own TERMINAL-ARCHITECTURE note below for the fix that actually closes the
 * remaining gap.
 *
 * `find <path> -type s` (GNU findutils, present in every trusted directory
 * this module's `TRUSTED_SETUP_PATH`/`TRUSTED_LAUNCHER_DIRECTORIES` already
 * trust) rather than a hand-rolled shell walk — confirmed empirically it
 * does NOT follow symlinks by default (no `-L` flag given), matching the
 * host-side scanner's own symlink-avoidance, and does not hang against a
 * self-referential symlink loop.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED ON AN UNREADABLE SUBTREE (P1-2, the review's OTHER half of
 * this finding) — `find`'s own exit status distinguishes "fully enumerated,
 * found nothing" from "could not fully enumerate": confirmed empirically,
 * as an unprivileged user, `find <root>` against a subtree it cannot LIST
 * (`chmod 000`, or `chmod 311` — SEARCHABLE but not LISTABLE, a genuinely
 * separate permission bit from readability, see next paragraph) exits `1`
 * and prints `find: '<path>': Permission denied` to stderr, while still
 * printing every path it COULD enumerate before hitting the blocked
 * subtree. This function captures that exit status and treats ANY nonzero
 * exit from `find` as "could not prove this subtree clean," not "found
 * nothing" — the same fail-closed posture `req`/`SETUP_STEP_FAILURE_EXIT_CODE`
 * already applies to every OTHER mandatory setup step, extended here to an
 * enumeration failure rather than a command failure.
 *
 * DIRECTORY READ VS SEARCH ARE SEPARATE PERMISSIONS (confirmed empirically,
 * unprivileged user, both this module's own scan AND a real socket dial):
 * a directory with mode `311` (search/execute bit set, read bit NOT set)
 * cannot be LISTED — `find`/`readdir` against it fails `EACCES`, so a
 * socket with an UNKNOWN name inside it is invisible to enumeration — but a
 * socket with a KNOWN name inside it stays fully STAT-able and CONNECTABLE
 * (confirmed live: a client successfully connected to a socket under a
 * `chmod 311` directory whose contents `find`/`readdirSync` could not list).
 * This means a `311` subtree is not merely "harder to see into" than a
 * `000` one — both fail identically at the enumeration step (`find` exits
 * nonzero for either), so both correctly fall into the SAME fail-closed
 * branch here; the distinction matters for WHY the scan must fail closed on

 * verifier-owned IMMUTABLE snapshot of every required input (taken once,
 * before the scenario's first run, and never re-read from the live host
 * filesystem again) would close the window entirely rather than narrowing
 * it. Not built this round: it is a substantially larger architectural
 * change (the isolated child's binds would need to come from the snapshot
 * itself, not `requiredFilesystemBinds()`'s live paths) than this bounded
 * repair's scope covers.
 *
 * Returns a shell statement, NOT wrapped in `req` — `req`'s own diagnostic
 * wording ("setup step [...] failed") doesn't fit a scan finding a REAL
 * socket (not a setup command failing), so this builds its own message and

/**
 * POST-PIVOT VERIFICATION (P1-1, ninth review, requirement (c)) — proves,
 * rather than assumes, that the filesystem closure actually took effect,
 * run as the LAST gate before `exec <target>` (see `spawnWithNetworkIsolation`'s
 * unshare branch). Every check here uses only shell builtins (`[`, `set --`
 * globbing) — no external binary — so it cannot itself be defeated by a
 * shadowed/missing tool the way the setup steps above could be before
 * `TRUSTED_SETUP_PATH` was introduced.
 *
 * Three independent properties, matching the review's requirement exactly:
 *   1. NEW ROOT ACTIVE — `/` is the staged tmpfs, not the original host
 *      root. Checked via `/pdpp-isolation-canary`, a file this function
 *      writes into the STAGING tree (i.e. it will exist at `/` once the
 *      pivot succeeds) immediately before `pivot_root` runs — if `pivot_root`
 *      silently failed to change the effective root (the exact false-success
 *      shape the review's `(a)` scenario describes), this file would be
 *      absent from the now-still-original `/`.
 *   2. `/oldroot` UNREACHABBLE — after `umount -l /oldroot`, the directory
 *      itself remains (as an empty mountpoint stub — `umount` removes the
 *      MOUNT, not the directory entry) but must contain NOTHING: `set --
 *      /oldroot/*` glob-expands to the literal string `/oldroot/*` (unmatched)
 *      when the directory is empty, and dash leaves `$1` as that literal
 *      unexpanded pattern in that case — `[ -e "$1" ]` against the literal
 *      pattern string then correctly reports "does not exist" only when the
 *      directory is genuinely empty (proven empirically: matches Linux's
 *      documented behavior for `umount -l` — the lazy detach leaves an empty,
 *      unmounted directory, not a leftover reachable filesystem view).
 *   3. EVERY DECLARED `ro` BIND IS ACTUALLY READ-ONLY — attempts to `touch`
 *      a real probe file under each `ro`-mode bind's real path; success (the
 *      touch did NOT fail) means the remount-ro step from setup did not
 *      actually take effect for that specific path, which is exactly
 *      scenario (b) in the review's false-success list (a preceding bind
 *      remains writable and nothing verifies it). The probe file itself is
 *      removed immediately after a successful write (defense in depth — the
 *      isolated child is about to be torn down/killed anyway, but leaving a
 *      stray file in `/usr` or `/etc` if this check ever legitimately fires
 *      would be an unrelated mess on top of a real security finding).
 *
 * Any failure here uses `POST_PIVOT_VERIFICATION_FAILURE_EXIT_CODE` (91),
 * distinguishing it from a setup STEP failing (90) or the procfs-specific
 * gate (97) — the diagnostic names exactly which of the three properties
 * failed.
 */
/**
 * The `probe_ro` shell function definition (P1-3, external review of
 * ced8300be) — a single write-probe usable against EITHER a directory OR a
 * FILE bind mount, echoing the path if it's still writable (the false-
 * success shape every caller of this function checks for) and nothing if
 * genuinely read-only.
 *
 * FILE SUBMOUNTS COULD NOT BE VERIFIED (P1-3, the review's second half of
 * this finding): the prior probe was `touch <path>/.pdpp-isolation-ro-probe`
 * — creating a NEW file INSIDE the probed path, which only makes sense for
 * a DIRECTORY target. Confirmed empirically against a real file bind mount
 * (e.g. the shape Docker's own `/etc/resolv.conf` injection produces — a
 * single FILE bind-mounted onto another single file, not a directory):
 * `touch <file-mount>/.probe` fails with `ENOTDIR` ("Not a directory")
 * REGARDLESS of whether the file mount is actually read-only or not — so
 * the old probe reported EVERY file submount as "confirmed read-only" even
 * when a separate, direct write proved it was still genuinely writable
 * (reproduced live: `echo x > <file-mount>` succeeded while the old
 * `touch <file-mount>/.probe` probe simultaneously reported "read-only" for
 * the exact same still-writable target) — a false negative, the "confirmed
 * clean when it is not" shape this whole verification exists to prevent.
 *
 * FIX: branch on `[ -d "$path" ]`. For a directory, keep the original
 * create-a-file-inside probe (a file bind mount has no "inside" to probe
 * this way, but a directory's own write permission is exactly what creating
 * an entry inside it tests). For anything else (a file, confirmed via `-d`
 * being false rather than asserting `-f` — matches this module's existing
 * "test the property that matters, not a narrower assumption about what
 * else the path could be" discipline elsewhere), open the path itself
 * for write in append mode via shell redirection (`exec 3>>"$path"`). This
 * asks the kernel for write access without `O_TRUNC` and performs no write,
 * so a host-backed file submount keeps its exact bytes. It correctly fails
 * with `EROFS`/a shell-level "Read-only file system" error for a genuinely
 * read-only file bind mount, and correctly SUCCEEDS (proving writability,
 * the false-success case) for a writable one — unlike the old
 * `ENOTDIR`-always probe, this actually depends on the mount's real
 * read-only state rather than failing unconditionally for the wrong reason.
