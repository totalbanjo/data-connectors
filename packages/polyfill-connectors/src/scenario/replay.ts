/**
 * Strictly offline replay `fetch` for a single scenario run. `createReplayFetch`
 * never touches the network by construction — the only data source it reads
 * from is `scenarioRun.interactions`, already materialized in memory.
 *
 * Matching is intentionally strict: method + origin + path + sorted
 * normalized query + body_sha256 (when the recorded interaction has one).
 * Interactions sharing the same match key are consumed strictly in recorded
 * order (a FIFO per key), so a connector issuing the "same" request twice in
 * a row (e.g. re-polling the same endpoint on two pages of a cursor loop)
 * gets each recorded response exactly once, in the order they were captured.
 *
 * NORMALIZER MISUSE GUARD: a normalizer strips a query param from the match
 * key entirely, which means two interactions that differ ONLY in that
 * param's value (e.g. `page=1` vs `page=2`) collapse onto the SAME key and
 * become a FIFO queue. That is exactly right for a genuinely volatile,
 * provider-issued value (a `next_token` the server handed back in an
 * earlier response) — the request's value can't be predicted at match time,
 * so the match key can't include it. It is exactly WRONG for a static,
 * caller-controlled value like a `page` number: if the collector's actual
 * request order ever diverges from recorded order (a bug, a retry, or a
 * hostile scenario file), the FIFO queue silently serves page 2's recorded
 * response to a request that asked for page 1, or vice versa — the record
 * counts might still add up while individual records are swapped.
 *
 * The guard: when a request matches an interaction's key, for every
 * normalized param present in BOTH the request and the recorded
 * interaction whose values differ, the request's value must appear in the
 * `providerIssuedValues` set this module collects from response bodies
 * ALREADY SERVED during this replay run (same "string leaf >= 8 chars,
 * capped" rule as record.ts's `collectProviderIssuedValues`, so a value
 * only counts as provider-issued once its origin response has actually been
 * replayed, matching the causal order the real recording process observed
 * it in). A differing value that never appeared in an earlier served
 * response is not something the provider could have handed the collector —
 * it is either a hardcoded/guessed value or an out-of-order replay, and
 * `createReplayFetch` throws `ScenarioMismatchError` naming the param
 * rather than silently serving whatever the FIFO cursor happens to point
 * at.
 *
 * BINDING RESOLUTION (format.ts's `ScenarioInteraction.bindings`): a bound
 * query param (e.g. an OAuth-issued cursor) is excluded from its OWN
 * interaction's match key — same rationale as a normalizer, but declared
 * per-interaction rather than scenario-wide — and is instead checked
 * separately once an interaction is otherwise matched: the live request
 * must carry the bound param, and its value must equal the value resolved
 * from the response body THIS REPLAY RUN ACTUALLY SERVED for the binding's
 * `source_seq`, at `json_path`. A missing param or a differing value throws
 * `ScenarioBindingMismatchError` naming the binding, rather than silently
 * matching (or silently failing to match) on a key that happened to still
 * line up.
