/**
 * REPLAY half of the `"recorded-browser"` driver — HAR-backed browser
 * network replay for connectors that drive their own HTTP traffic through
 * `page.evaluate(fetch)` inside a Patchright browser context (chatgpt,
 * amazon, and every other browser-driven connector), where the existing
 * `recorded-http` driver's `globalThis.fetch`/`node:http` preload
 * (subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts) structurally cannot see anything: that
 * traffic never touches the connector Node process's own fetch/http/net —
 * it originates inside the browser's own JS engine.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP NOTE: this module does NOT edit src/browser-launch.ts or
 * bin/scenario-record.ts (owned by the sibling RECORD-half lane). Instead it
 * follows the exact pattern subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts's REPLAY preload
 * already established for `node:http`/`node:net`: a NODE_OPTIONS preload
 * module, installed via `--import` BEFORE the connector subprocess's own
 * code (and therefore before its `import("./browser-launch.ts") ->
 * import("patchright")` chain) ever runs, that patches patchright's
 * `chromium` `BrowserType` PROTOTYPE method `launchPersistentContext` —
 * confirmed empirically (own-property-descriptor probe) writable/
 * configurable on the prototype, and — because `import("patchright")` is a
 * cached singleton within one process — visible to every LATER dynamic
 * import of the same module, including browser-launch.ts's own. This is the
 * same "Node's built-in/vendored module namespace objects are mutable, and a
 * later import sees an earlier import's patch" property
 * `writeReplayBridgePreload` already documents and relies on for
 * `node:http`.
 *
 * ─── SCOPE: DATA MAPPING, NOT CHOREOGRAPHY ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * See format.ts's `ScenarioBrowserNetworkDriver` doc comment for the full
 * statement — restated here because it drives every design choice below:
 * this driver replays NETWORK TRAFFIC into the connector's real browser
 * context via Playwright's `routeFromHAR`, then proves the connector's
 * DATA MAPPING (recorded responses -> emitted RECORDs) exactly the way
 * `recorded-http` proves it for fetch traffic — using the SAME
 * `verifyScenario`/RECORD-STATE-trace oracle in verify.ts, unchanged. It
 * does NOT attempt to prove click/navigation choreography deterministic:
 * anti-bot JS and timer nondeterminism make that non-reproducible across two
 * separate browser runs even against an identical HAR, so this driver never
 * tries. `claims.ts` enforces the consequence structurally (recorded-browser
 * can never reach the canonical `recorded_replay` claim) and via a mandatory
 * staleness limitation on every earned `diagnostic_replay: PASS`.
 *
 * ─── EGRESS DENIAL SCOPE (mirrors subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts's stance) ───
 *
 * `notFound: "abort"` on `context.routeFromHAR` is REQUIRED, never optional
 * (this module never constructs the options object without it) — an
 * unmatched request must fail loudly, never silently fall through to the
 * real network, exactly like `recorded-http`'s `ScenarioEgressDeniedError`
 * posture for a connector calling `node:http` directly. `serviceWorkers:
 * "block"` closes a real HAR-replay-specific gap `routeFromHAR` alone does
 * not: a page-registered service worker can intercept fetches BEFORE they
 * reach Playwright's routing layer and serve them from its own cache or let
 * them reach the real network, silently bypassing `notFound: "abort"`'s
 * egress-denial guarantee. Blocking service workers entirely for a replay
 * context closes that gap at the same layer this driver already controls
 * (context creation), rather than trying to detect/intercept SW-originated
 * requests after the fact.
 *
 * NOT CAPTURED/REPLAYED — WebSocket/EventSource/SSE traffic and browser
 * download events. See format.ts's `ScenarioBrowserNetworkDriver` doc
 * comment for why (Playwright's HAR machinery is HTTP request/response
 * only; download bodies can bypass route interception) and the standing
 * fleet fact backing the decision not to build for them (zero of this
 * package's connectors use either surface as of this driver's
 * introduction). If that ever changes, THIS is the file that needs a new
 * interception layer — noted here so the gap is a documented boundary, not
 * a silent one.
 *
 * ─── SESSION STATE (storage_state_path) ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Capture runs against a WARM persistent profile — the connector's page-side
 * JS decides whether it's logged in from real cookie/localStorage state, not
 * from anything this harness controls. A `launchPersistentContext` profile
 * directory does carry its own on-disk cookie jar, but the REPLAY profile
 * (a scenario-evidence-workspace-scoped throwaway directory — see
 * `browserReplayProfileDir`) starts genuinely empty; without an explicit
 * storage-state injection, the app takes the login-wall path and every
 * subsequent request the page issues misses the HAR entirely (the
 * login-wall page's own requests were never recorded), which surfaces as a
 * confusing CASCADE of unrelated `notFound: "abort"` aborts instead of one
 * clear diagnosis. `assertStorageStateUsable` (below) checks this BEFORE any
 * browser launches and fails with one specific, named reason instead.
 *
 * ─── CLOCK (fixed_now) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Connectors compute date-window request params (e.g. a 30-day scope
 * window) from wall-clock "now" — a HAR captured today therefore encodes
 * URLs that will stop matching a live-clock replay the moment enough real
 * time has passed for the window to shift. `run.clock.fixed_now` (format.ts,
 * pre-existing, driver-neutral) is the SAME mechanism `recorded-http` replay
 * already uses for the connector Node process's own `Date.now()`/timers
 * (subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts's REPLAY preload, gated on
 * `PDPP_SCENARIO_CLOCK_FIXED_NOW_ENV`) — this module extends that, it does
 * not invent a parallel clock. TWO clocks need pinning for a browser
 * scenario, and this module pins BOTH from the same `fixed_now`:
 *   (1) the connector Node PROCESS clock — this preload's generated source
 *       includes the identical `Date`/`setTimeout`/`setInterval` patch
 *       `writeReplayBridgePreload` installs (necessarily duplicated, not
 *       imported — this preload's source is serialized into a standalone
 *       `.mjs` module that runs in a separate OS process with no access to
 *       this package's module graph, the same constraint that file's own
 *       doc comment states for `scaleReplayDelayMs`);
 *   (2) the in-PAGE clock — Playwright's `context.clock.install({time})`
 *       (called once per created context, inside the patched
 *       `launchPersistentContext` wrapper below), which patches the
 *       browser's own `Date`/timers for every page in that context. Without
 *       this, a browser-side date computation (many connectors build their
 *       date-window query params via in-page `new Date()`, not Node-side)
 *       would keep drifting from the HAR's capture time even though the
 *       Node-side clock was pinned.
 *
 * ─── NO AUTOMATIC RE-RECORD/REFRESH ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This module has no code path that re-captures, refreshes, or extends a
 * HAR/storage-state file's validity — no timer-based re-record (the failure
 * mode VCR's `re_record_interval` and similar "cassette" tooling exhibit:
 * a passing replay can silently mean "the cassette was quietly
 * re-recorded a moment ago", not "this exact evidence still matches").
 * Re-capture is scenario-record.ts's job (the sibling lane), triggered only
 * by an explicit human-run command — never something this replay path
 * decides to do on a schedule, on a miss, or on staleness. The staleness
 * limitation (claims.ts's `buildBrowserStalenessLimitation`) exists
 * BECAUSE this module refuses to paper over the problem automatically.

/**
 * ─── ISOLATED REPLAY PROFILE (never the connector's live `~/.pdpp/profiles`) ──
 *
 * `browser-launch.ts`'s `acquireIsolatedBrowser` always calls
 * `localChromium.launchPersistentContext(isolatedDir, ...)` with
 * `isolatedDir` resolved from `PDPP_BROWSER_PROFILE_ROOT` (default
 * `~/.pdpp/profiles/<profileName>`) — the OWNER'S REAL, PERSISTENT browser
 * profile, the one their live capture/record runs (and any other connector
 * invocation) actually write session cookies into. Reproduced directly: a
 * replay launched against that path hangs for the full watchdog timeout
 * behind that profile's own lock file (patchright's persistent-context lock,
 * `<userDataDir>/SingletonLock`) whenever anything else touched the profile
 * recently, and — even when it doesn't hang — is not hermetic: replay is
 * supposed to prove the DATA MAPPING recorded in `storage_state_path`/the
 * HAR, not "whatever session state happens to be on disk on the machine
 * running verify today". `context.setStorageState(...)` below seeds the
 * REPLAY context correctly, but only fixes correctness if that context was
 * never launched against the live profile in the first place — seeding a
 * context that has already read the live profile's on-disk cookie jar at
 * launch does not undo that read.
 *
 * The wrapper below therefore ignores the `userDataDir` argument
 * `acquireIsolatedBrowser` passes (the real profile path) and substitutes a
 * fresh, empty, per-run temp directory — never seeded from anything but
 * `context.setStorageState(STORAGE_STATE_PATH)` immediately after launch.
 * This closes all three problems named in the task that motivated it:
 * correctness (replay evidence is ONLY the captured storage state, never
 * ambient live-profile disk state), reliability (a fresh mkdtemp directory
 * has no pre-existing `SingletonLock` to contend with), and safety (replay
 * can now structurally never read from OR write to the owner's real
 * profile directory — it never opens it at all).
 *
 * Cleaned up via `process.once("exit", ...)` (synchronous — the only
 * lifecycle hook guaranteed to run before the subprocess actually exits;
 * an async `finally` in the connector's own code is not something this
 * preload controls) rather than left for the OS temp-dir janitor, matching
 * this module's existing cleanup discipline for its own generated preload
 * file (bin/scenario-verify.ts's `runBrowserCollector` `finally` block).
 * Unique per LAUNCH CALL — `mkdtempSync`'s own random-suffix guarantee, the
 * same primitive `createScenarioEvidenceWorkspace` (subprocess-fetch-
 * preloads.ts) already relies on for collision-free naming — so two
 * concurrent replay subprocesses, or one subprocess whose connector calls
 * `acquireIsolatedBrowser` more than once in a single run, never collide on
 * the same directory.
 *
 * ─── THIS DRIVER DOES NOT SCALE setTimeout/setInterval (Date IS still pinned) ──
 *
 * `writeReplayBridgePreload`'s (subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts) REPLAY-side
 * `REPLAY_TIME_SCALE` timer scaling exists to compress the CONNECTOR's own
 * pacing/backoff waits (`politeDelay`, governor pacing, inline
 * `PAGE_DELAY_MS` sleeps) — every one of those is built on the global
 * `setTimeout`/`setInterval`. Reproduced directly, in three escalating
 * probes, while making replay actually work end-to-end against a real
 * captured scenario: that same global `setTimeout` is ALSO what
 * patchright/Playwright's OWN internal API timeouts are built on —
 * `launchPersistentContext({timeout})`, `page.goto({timeout})`,
 * `locator.click({timeout})`, `waitForSelector`, effectively every
 * Playwright call that accepts a `timeout` option. With scaling installed,
 * a `launchPersistentContext({timeout: 180000})` call failed after ~1800ms
 * of REAL time (180000 / 100 = 1800) — and even after narrowing the fix to
 * restore real timers around JUST that one call, `page.goto({timeout:
 * 10000})` against the routed HAR immediately afterward failed the same way
 * (10000 / 100 = 100ms real). `recorded-http` never hits this: its preload
 * scales the SAME timers but never drives a real patchright instance
 * in-process at all — the fetch/http mocking there has nothing to do with
 * Playwright's own timeout machinery. `recorded-browser` is the first
 * driver to put a real, live-for-the-whole-run Playwright instance and this
 * scaling patch in the same process, and Playwright timeouts fire
 * throughout a run's entire lifetime (every navigation, every wait), not
 * only at launch — there is no single call boundary narrow enough to wrap
 * with a temporary real-timer restore without either missing some
 * Playwright call (still broken) or wrapping so broadly that the
 * connector's OWN pacing waits stop being scaled anyway (defeating the
 * point).
 *
 * Decision: this driver's preload installs NO `setTimeout`/`setInterval`
 * scaling at all — real timers throughout, for both Playwright's internals
 * and the connector's own pacing waits. This is the SAFER of the two
 * choices, not merely the simpler one: this file's own module doc
 * ("SCOPE: DATA MAPPING, NOT CHOREOGRAPHY") already establishes that this
 * driver never attempts deterministic click/navigation TIMING — only the
 * DATA proven by routeFromHAR matters — so real time elapsing during
 * navigation/interaction is not a correctness problem here the way a
 * skipped connector-code wait might be. The cost is bounded: browser-driven
 * connectors' own explicit pacing is small relative to page-load time
 * (reddit's, for example, is a single 500ms `politeDelay` between pages —
 * see connectors/reddit/index.ts's `PAGE_DELAY_MS`), so real replay time
 * here is dominated by real Chromium page-load/network-idle waits either
 * way, not by whether a 500ms pacing sleep was compressed to 5ms.
 * `Date`/`Date.now()` pinning (this file's module doc comment, "CLOCK")
 * stays — it is a VALUE read (needed so a connector's in-page date-window
 * computation matches the HAR's capture time), not a deadline-timer
 * mechanism, and a separate direct probe confirmed patching `Date` alone
 * (no timer scaling) does not perturb `launchPersistentContext` or
 * `page.goto` timeout behavior at all.
 */

/**
 * Generated module written by `writeBrowserHarReplayPreload` below does
 * `await import("patchright")` — a BARE specifier, unlike every other
 * preload this package generates (subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts's preloads
 * only import `node:*` builtins, which need no package resolution at all).
 * Node resolves a bare specifier by walking UP from the IMPORTING module's
 * own path looking for the nearest `node_modules` containing it. Writing
 * this file into `workspace.dir` (a `mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), ...))`
 * directory — see subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts's `createScenarioEvidenceWorkspace`)
 * would put it under `os.tmpdir()`, OUTSIDE this package tree entirely: that
 * walk reaches `/` and never finds this package's `node_modules/patchright`,
 * so the generated preload's own `import("patchright")` dies with
 * `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` before any of its patching ever runs. Reproduced
 * directly; not a hypothetical.
 *
 * This is the IDENTICAL defect class commit 2b674fdf1 fixed for
 * bin/scenario-cli.test.ts's generated connector fixtures (which import
 * src/connector-runtime.ts -> @pdpp/connector-protocol and hit the same
 * resolution walk, failing with ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED instead). That
 * fix's convention is reused verbatim here: write the file inside THIS
 * package tree, under the repo's existing gitignored `tmp/` (root
 * `.gitignore`'s bare `tmp/` line already matches
 * `packages/polyfill-connectors/tmp/`), with unique per-run naming so
 * concurrent runs never collide, and 0600 permissions matching this
 * function's existing security posture (this evidence is
 * `capture.privacy_class: "local-only"` — see subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts's
 * "Secure evidence workspace" module doc comment). Deliberately NARROWER
 * than that precedent: only THIS preload file moves — `workspace` (the 0700
 * mkdtemp evidence workspace) is untouched and still holds the HAR/
 * storage-state paths' resolution base, the UDS bridge socket, and
 * everything `runReplaySubprocess`'s network-namespace isolation binds —
 * none of which import anything and so none of which need to live inside
 * the package tree.
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERED — resolve patchright's absolute path in the PARENT
 * process (where resolution already works) and bake that path into the
 * generated `import(...)` call instead of moving the file: rejected in favor
 * of relocation. Baking in an absolute path freezes today's install layout
 * (e.g. pnpm's `.pnpm/patchright@<version>/node_modules/patchright/...`)
 * into generated source; a different install layout (npm/yarn classic
 * flat node_modules, a different pnpm hoist config, Yarn PnP where
 * `import.meta.resolve` behaves differently or virtual paths are involved)
 * could resolve to something this preload's baked-in path no longer matches,
 * or that patchright's own internal asset/binary lookups (relative to ITS
 * own module location) don't expect to be imported from. Writing the file
 * inside the package tree instead lets Node's ordinary resolution algorithm
 * do the work fresh every run, in every environment — no dependency on how

 *      three-probe reproduction showing why: that scaling collides with
 *      Playwright/patchright's own internal per-call timeout machinery,
 *      which is built on the identical global `setTimeout` and live for a
 *      run's entire browser session, not just at launch.
 *   2. Dynamically imports `patchright` once, up front (winning the same

 *      `writeReplayBridgePreload` already relies on for `node:http` — see

 *   3. Replaces `chromium`'s PROTOTYPE `launchPersistentContext` with a
 *      wrapper that: substitutes a fresh isolated profile directory for
 *      whatever `userDataDir` the caller passed (this file's module doc
 *      comment, "ISOLATED REPLAY PROFILE"); calls the REAL implementation
 *      with `serviceWorkers: "block"` forced into the options (overriding

 *      `context.setStorageState(storageStatePath)` on the returned context
 *      BEFORE returning it to the caller (browser-launch.ts's

 *      pins Date.now() to.
 *
 * Written into this package's own gitignored `tmp/` (via `packageScratchDir`
