/**
 * Records a connector run's HTTP traffic into `ScenarioInteraction[]` for a
 * single scenario run. `createRecordingFetch` wraps an underlying `fetch`
 * (real or, in this spike, an in-process synthetic provider) so a connector
 * calling the wrapped function is unaware it's being recorded.
 *
 * Redaction happens BEFORE anything is handed to the sink — never after.
 * There is no "redact on read" path: a value this module doesn't persist
 * never exists in the sink's storage to begin with.
 *
 * A query param whose name matches the credential pattern is either:
 *   - a genuine client-supplied credential (its value never appeared in an
 *     EARLIER recorded response body in this run) — redacted and listed as a
 *     normalizer, as before; or
 *   - provider-issued (pagination cursors like `next_token`, continuation
 *     tokens — its value DID appear in an earlier response body) — recorded
 *     as a `ScenarioBinding` ({param, source_seq, json_path}) instead of a
 *     raw query value. The param is excluded from the stored query entirely
 *     (neither the raw value nor a normalizer entry) — replay resolves the
 *     expected value from the response it actually served for `source_seq`
 *     (see replay.ts's binding resolution), so the value is proven without
 *     ever being persisted raw.
 *
 * FIX 4 (recorder unification, re-review): this module previously kept a
 * provider-issued credential-named value RAW in the stored query (the "kept,
 * not redacted" heuristic) — diverging from
 * `src/scenario/subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts`'s RECORD preload, which
 * already produces bindings. Provenance is not non-secrecy: a value being
 * provider-issued only proves the RECORDER doesn't need to protect it from
 * itself (the recorder already saw it in a response) — it says nothing about
 * whether the value is safe to leave sitting in a committed/shared scenario
 * file's request query, which is exactly the class of exposure the binding
 * model (never persisting the value at all, only its provenance) closes.
 * This module now matches the preload's binding model exactly, so the
 * in-process recorder (used by unit tests and connector spikes) and the
 * subprocess recorder (used by `bin/scenario-record.ts`) can never diverge
 * on what "safe to persist" means.
