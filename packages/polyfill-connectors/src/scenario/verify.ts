 * Verifies a scenario against the real connector collect path, strictly
 * offline. For each run, in order:
 *   1. Seed state — `null`, or (when `start.state_from_run` is set) the
 *      ACTUAL final state a prior verified run in THIS verification pass
 *      emitted (never the scenario's originally-recorded `start.state`,
 *      which is reference-only).
 *   2. Execute the real collect path via `runCollector(runIndex, {fetch,
 *      emit, state})` against `createReplayFetch` for this run's
 *      interactions. `emit` is this module's own capture of the protocol's
 *      RECORD/STATE messages — the caller's collector calls it exactly like
 *      it would call the real runtime's emit/emitRecord.
 *   3. Assert per-stream record counts/ids/content hashes and the run's
 *      final committed state against `run.expected`.
 *
 * `final_state` is built the same way the reference runtime commits STATE
 * messages: `newState[stream] = cursor` per STATE message, merged onto the
 * run's seed state (see reference-implementation/runtime/index.ts's
 * `handleStateMessage`: `newState[stateStream] = msg.cursor`). This module
 * reimplements that one-line merge rather than importing the runtime, since
 * pulling in the full reference runtime here would be a much heavier
 * dependency for a single merge rule.
 *
 * ─── Protocol-trace oracle (additive) ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * PDPP connectors' primary truth is COMPLETENESS semantics, not just which
 * records got emitted — a connector that silently drops a detail gap instead
 * of reporting it, or that claims `DONE(succeeded)` after a run that actually
 * hit an unrecoverable provider error, has lied about completeness even if
 * every RECORD it did emit was byte-correct. `run.expected.protocol_trace`
 * (format.ts, additive) captures a normalized, emission-order projection of
 * the seven completeness-bearing message kinds (SKIP_RESULT, DETAIL_COVERAGE,
 * DETAIL_GAP, DETAIL_GAP_ATTEMPTED, DETAIL_GAP_RECOVERED,
 * DETAIL_GAPS_PAGE_REQUEST, and the terminal DONE — see `TRACE_POLICY` below
 * for the machine-enforced, exhaustive statement of every `EmittedMessage`
 * kind's disposition) so a scenario can prove them too, not just
 * RECORD/STATE.
 * `normalizeTraceMessage` (below) is the single normalization function both
 * `bin/scenario-record.ts` (building the expected trace at capture time) and
 * this module (comparing the actual trace at replay time) call, so record
 * and verify can never drift on what "the same trace" means. `verifyTrace`
 * performs the comparison and reports a `trace_mismatch` VerifyFailure naming
 * the first divergence.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED SHAPE CHECKING (repair wave 3B, P1-3; extended repair wave 4,
 * P2-1 to "strict parsers reject, never sanitize" — every truth-bearing
 * field, not just the top-level required ones): every tracked kind now
 * has a STRICT shape check. A message whose `type` is one of the tracked
 * kinds but fails that kind's shape check — a required field missing, wrong
 * type, or (for `detail_gap`) `reason` outside the closed enum — throws
 * `TraceNormalizationError` instead of silently normalizing to `undefined`
 * and dropping out of the trace. This applies identically whether the
 * message came from a REAL run being recorded (`bin/scenario-record.ts`'s
 * `buildProtocolTrace` call, which has no try/catch around it — a malformed
 * emit fails the recording outright) or a replay being verified (this
 * module's `verifyRun`). The previous behavior — silently returning
 * `undefined` for a malformed tracked-kind message — would have let a
 * connector emit a truncated/malformed completeness message and have it
 * vanish from the trace as if it were an untracked kind like PROGRESS,
 * exactly the silent-drop failure mode this oracle exists to catch. Untracked
 * kinds (RECORD, STATE, PROGRESS, INTERACTION, ASSISTANCE, ASSISTANCE_STATUS,
 * and anything else) are unaffected — `normalizeTraceMessage` returns
 * `undefined` for those without throwing, exactly as before.

 *   - `"unsupported_claim_withheld"` — ASSISTANCE/ASSISTANCE_STATUS: the

 *     oracle has no driver to verify against (format.ts's
