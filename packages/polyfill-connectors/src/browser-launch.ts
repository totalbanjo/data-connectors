 * Browser-launch primitive for polyfill connectors.
 *
 * Launches a per-connector patchright Chromium with an isolated profile
 * directory. Used by the connector runtime (`connector-runtime.ts`) and by
 * operator-side scripts under `bin/` that need a Chromium context.
 *
 * Profile directories live under `~/.pdpp/profiles/<profileName>/` by default,
 * or under the deployment-owned `PDPP_BROWSER_PROFILE_ROOT` when configured.
 * Each profile is independent: cookies, localStorage, and "trusted device" state
 * persist across runs of the same connector but never cross between
 * connectors. Concurrent runs across different `profileName`s are safe.
 *
 * Patchright is the patched-Playwright drop-in (replaces rebrowser-playwright
 * 2026-04-21). Importing patchright in the launching module activates the
 * full stealth stack (launch-side + client-side); using stock playwright over
 * CDP would forfeit the client-side layer.
 *
 * Container policy: Core owns the browser mode for local sessions. Its
 * browser-bearing image advertises `PDPP_RUNTIME_BROWSER=1` and its supervisor
 * supplies a managed Xvfb `DISPLAY`, so the normal local launch is a visible
 * headed Chromium even though the service has no physical desktop. Other
 * containers still fail closed unless they provide the existing escape hatch
 * or attach to an operator-visible remote CDP browser such as n.eko.

 *
 *   Protocol error (Network.setCacheDisabled): Internal server error, session closed.
 *       at ... crNetworkManager.setRequestInterception
 *
 * Root cause (verified against patchright-core 1.61.1 internals):
 * Patchright's `CRPage` constructor eagerly calls
 * `this._networkManager.setRequestInterception(true)` so its stealth
 * Fetch-domain hooks are always active (`server/chromium/crPage.js` line 80).
 * Stock Playwright does NOT — it defers to a conditional
 * `updateRequestInterception()`. Critically, that constructor call is FLOATED:
 * no `await`, no `.catch`. Patchright's `setRequestInterception` ends with a
 * patchright-only
 * `_forEachSession(info => info.session.send("Network.setCacheDisabled", …))`
 * (`server/chromium/crNetworkManager.js`). When `connectOverCDP` auto-attaches
 * (`Target.setAutoAttach`) to every existing target, `_onAttachedToTarget`
 * builds a `CRPage` per target — including the short-lived `about:blank` target
 * n.eko opens via `/json/new?about:blank` and immediately tears down via
 * `/json/close`. If that target's session disposes while the send is in flight,
 * the in-flight callback is rejected with `Internal server error, session
 * closed.` (`crConnection.js` `dispose()`). The MAIN-frame branch of
 * `_forEachSession` has no `.catch` guard (only non-main sessions swallow
 * `isSessionClosedError`).
 *
 * Because the offending `setRequestInterception(true)` is floated and
 * `connectOverCDP` only awaits `_waitForAllPagesToBeInitialized()` (NOT the
 * interception promise), `connectOverCDP` RESOLVES successfully and the
 * rejection escapes the entire connect promise chain as a Node UNHANDLED
 * REJECTION (`node:internal/process/promises`), terminating the process a tick
 * or two after attach. This is why a `try/catch` around `connectOverCDP` (v1)
 * never observed it. The catch boundary now lives in
 * `runCdpAttemptWithRaceGuard`, which intercepts the unhandled rejection.
 *
 * The condition is inherently transient: the offending target is on its way
 * out. A bounded retry a moment later — once n.eko's transient target has
 * disposed and only the stable page target remains — attaches cleanly.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT switch the remote-attach client to stock Playwright:
 * patchright's `Runtime.enable` suppression and isolated-world hiding are
 * CLIENT-driven stealth (sent over CDP by the driving process, not baked into
 * the launched browser). A stock client attaching to the same browser would
 * leak the canonical CDP `Runtime.enable` automation signal on every page —
 * a permanent stealth regression on a bot-hostile target like Amazon, traded
 * for a transient startup race. Retry keeps full patchright stealth.
 *

 * `this._networkManager.setRequestInterception(true)` with NO `await` and NO
 * `.catch` (`server/chromium/crPage.js`). That floated promise runs
 * `_forEachSession(… "Network.setCacheDisabled" …)`, whose MAIN-frame branch has
 * no session-closed guard. When n.eko's transient `about:blank` target disposes
 * mid-send, the floated promise rejects, and because nobody is awaiting it the
 * rejection escapes the entire `connectOverCDP` promise chain as a Node
 * UNHANDLED REJECTION (`node:internal/process/promises`), terminating the
 * process. A `try/catch` around `connectOverCDP` (v1) can never see it.
 *
 * The fix installs a temporary `process.on("unhandledRejection")` listener and
 * races the attach attempt against that signal. If the race lands while
 * `connect()` is still pending, the attempt rejects immediately instead of
 * waiting for Patchright's 30s timeout. If `connect()` resolves first, the
 * guard stays open for a short settle window because the floated rejection can
 * land on a later tick. Either way, a matching unhandled rejection becomes a
 * retryable rejection of this attempt; the caller's bounded retry then
 * re-attaches once n.eko's transient target is gone.
 *
 * Safety rails:
 *   - The listener is ALWAYS removed when the attempt settles (success,
 *     retryable race, or fail-fast), via the `finally` block. We never leave a
 *     global listener installed across attempts.
 *   - Only the narrow race signature is consumed. Any OTHER unhandled rejection
 *     is re-thrown synchronously from the listener after removing ourselves, so
 *     Node's default crash-on-unhandled-rejection behavior is preserved for
 *     unrelated bugs. We do not become a process-wide rejection sink.
 *   - If the race rejection arrives after `connect()` already returned a live
 *     browser, or `connect()` resolves after the guard has already rejected,
 *     the injected `disconnect` is invoked best-effort so we don't leak a CDP
 *     client.
