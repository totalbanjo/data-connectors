/**
 * Test-only connector fixture for `bin/scenario-fidelity.test.ts`'s
 * seq-at-initiation proof: fires TWO requests concurrently
 * (`Promise.all`, not awaited one at a time) against a provider that
 * resolves the SECOND-initiated request FIRST (`/slow` sleeps before
 * responding; `/fast` responds immediately) — so the requests' seq numbers
 * can only reflect call order (both initiated before either resolves), not
 * response-completion order, if FIX 1(c) is actually in effect. Recording
 * seq at response-completion (the pre-fix behavior) would number `/fast`
 * (completes first) ahead of `/slow` even though `/slow` was called first.
 *
 * NOT registered in `src/orchestrator.ts` — fixture-only, never a
 * production connector.
