/**
 * Test-only connector fixture that emits ONE Collection Profile INTERACTION
 * mid-run with `kind: "credentials"` — the counterpart to
 * `connector-dev-interaction-fixture.ts`'s `kind: "otp"` fixture, used to
 * prove the repair wave's FIX C: a credentials-kind prompt/response pair
 * must NEVER be persisted with a real value in a recorded scenario, and
 * `scenario-verify` must refuse outright to replay a redacted entry rather
 * than silently answering with nothing.
 *
 * Unlike the OTP fixture, this fixture does NOT bake the interaction
 * response into an emitted record's content — it just needs `status:
 * "success"` back to proceed, so recording succeeds normally (proving FIX C
 * redacts a response scenario-record otherwise had no trouble capturing).
 *
 * Used by bin/scenario-cli.test.ts (FIX C: record redacts; verify refuses to
 * replay a redacted entry). NOT registered in src/orchestrator.ts —
 * fixture-only, never a production connector.
