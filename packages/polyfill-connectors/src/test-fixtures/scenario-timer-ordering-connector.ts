/**
 * Test-only connector fixture for `bin/scenario-cli.test.ts`'s replay
 * time-scaling coverage (`src/scenario/subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts`'s
 * `writeReplayBridgePreload` REPLAY TIME SCALING patch).
 *
 * Schedules two `setTimeout` timers CONCURRENTLY (both armed before either
 * is awaited) — a LONG one (`PDPP_TIMER_ORDER_LONG_MS`, default 3000) is
 * started first but takes longer, and a SHORT one
 * (`PDPP_TIMER_ORDER_SHORT_MS`, default 1000) is started second but takes
 * less time. Each emits one record when its timer fires. The emitted RECORD
 * order (not the scheduling order in source) is what a scenario replay
 * proves: "short" must always be emitted before "long".
 *
 * This is the ordering proof the time-scaling patch must preserve: scaling
 * every delay by a constant factor (REPLAY_TIME_SCALE) keeps "short still
 * shorter than long" true after scaling (1000ms/3000ms -> 10ms/30ms) even
 * though both wall-clock delays shrink. A broken scaling implementation that
 * instead collapsed every delay toward zero, or fired timers in registration
 * order regardless of delay, could flip this order — exactly the kind of
 * observable-control-flow change replay must never introduce.
 *
 * No network calls — pure timers, so this fixture works for both the
 * scenario-record (`--entrypoint`) and scenario-verify (replay) paths
 * without a synthetic HTTP provider, the same shape
 * `scenario-watchdog-paced-connector.ts` uses.
 *
 * NOT registered in src/orchestrator.ts — fixture-only, never a production
 * connector.
