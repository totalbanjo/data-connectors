/**
 * Test-only connector fixture for `bin/scenario-fidelity.test.ts`'s network
 * namespace isolation proof (FIX 3). This connector deliberately ESCAPES
 * the JS-layer `fetch` patching that `subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts`'s
 * replay preload installs — the entire point of `isolation.ts` is to close
 * exactly this gap at the OS layer, so the proof has to actually attempt
 * the escape a real misbehaving/compromised connector would:
 *
 *   1. Spawns `curl <canaryUrl>` as a CHILD PROCESS (child_process.spawn),
 *      not through `fetch` at all — the preload's JS-layer denial has no
 *      power over a spawned descendant's own network stack.
 *   2. ALSO makes one ordinary `fetch()` call through the bridge (to
 *      `PDPP_SCENARIO_FIDELITY_BASE_URL`, the test's normal in-scenario
 *      provider), proving the UDS bridge mode still works for legitimate
 *      traffic even while namespace-isolated.
 *
 * Reads the canary target from `PDPP_SCENARIO_FIDELITY_CANARY_URL` — a
 * parent-side plain HTTP server this fixture must NEVER be able to reach
 * when network-namespace isolation (isolation.ts's
 * `spawnWithNetworkIsolation`) actually wraps this process. Exits non-zero
 * if the curl escape unexpectedly reaches the canary (belt-and-suspenders —
 * the test's authoritative proof is the canary server's own hit counter,
 * which this fixture cannot fake since it runs in a separate process the
 * test parent observes directly).
 *
 * NOT registered in `src/orchestrator.ts` — fixture-only, never a
 * production connector.
