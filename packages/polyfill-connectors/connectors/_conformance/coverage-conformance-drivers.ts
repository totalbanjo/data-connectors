/**
 * Per-connector fixture drivers for `coverage-conformance.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each driver exercises a connector's REAL collection code — the same
 * `index.ts` entrypoint or exported orchestration function its own
 * integration test drives — against synthetic, credential-free fixtures
 * (a fake local HTTP/CardDAV server, a fake subprocess binary, a scripted
 * fetch, or an in-memory page/request stub). No connector source file is
 * modified: every driver reaches the connector only through an already-public
 * surface (an exported function, or the real stdin/stdout Collection Profile
 * protocol via `runConnectorProtocolSubprocess`).
 *
 * Two driver shapes cover every connector this gate drives:
 *   - `runDirectImportDriver` — calls an exported collection function
 *     in-process with a fake `CollectContext`; used for connectors with no
 *     rate governor whose production entrypoint takes a context object
 *     (Reddit, Amazon, GroupMe) or an injectable request seam (YNAB).
 *   - the subprocess drivers (Jellyfin, Apple Contacts, Google Messages) go
 *     through the real stdin/stdout protocol via `runConnectorProtocolSubprocess`
 *     against a fake local server or fake CLI binary.
 *
 * A driver returns `{ exercised: true, messages }` when it successfully ran
 * the connector to a real DONE (or the exported orchestration function
 * completed) and captured the emitted protocol messages. It returns
 * `{ exercised: false, reason }` when no cheap, deterministic, credential-free
 * fixture path exists — the gate reports that honestly rather than asserting
 * anything about a stream it never touched.
 *
 * Deliberately excluded from the aggregate gate: YNAB's per-budget streams
 * that route through its real governed `ynab()` fetch. Its module-level HTTP
 * governor (`createConnectorHttpGovernor` in connectors/ynab/index.ts) paces
 * every request through a real GCRA bucket with a 20-second floor interval
 * and no test-mode bypass. `ynabCollect`'s own sanctioned DI seam — an
 * injected `request` function (see `driveYnabAccountStats` below) — avoids
 * the governor entirely without bypassing or weakening it, so `account_stats`
 * (this gate's `singleton_presence` driver) is driven through it; the
 * remaining YNAB streams stay off this gate and rely on YNAB's own dedicated
 * suites (e.g. scheduled-transactions-coverage.test.ts, budgets-considered.test.ts).
 *
 * This module intentionally covers only the connectors this gate can
 * currently drive cheaply (a few seconds, no real network pacing) without
 * live credentials. Every other production-ready connector's required
 * stream is reported `unexercised`, not silently skipped and not assumed
 * broken.
