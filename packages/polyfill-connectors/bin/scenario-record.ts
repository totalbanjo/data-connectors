/**
 * scenario-record — the live-capture half of the developer capture→verify
 * loop for the connector-verification scenario harness (src/scenario/*.ts).
 *
 * Runs a connector's own entrypoint as a real subprocess, exactly the way
 * `bin/connector-dev.ts` does (`node --import tsx connectors/<name>/index.ts`,
 * START on stdin, JSONL RECORD/STATE/DONE on stdout), but with the
 * subprocess's `globalThis.fetch` patched via a `NODE_OPTIONS --import
 * <preload>` module (src/scenario/subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts's
 * `writeRecordPreload`) so every HTTP interaction it makes is captured. The
 * preload's `fetch` passes THROUGH to whatever `fetch` the subprocess would
 * otherwise use — real network by default — so this command talks to the
 * connector's real upstream with the developer's own credentials, resolved
 * from process.env exactly like `connector-dev.ts` and production.
 *
 * Captures two runs by default (`--runs 2`): run 1 from empty state (full
 * refresh), then run 2 immediately re-run seeded with run 1's ACTUAL
 * committed state (incremental narrowing) — the same two-run shape
 * connectors/oura/scenario.spike.test.ts proved against the real oura
 * connector. `--runs 1` captures only the full-refresh run.
 *
 * Writes a `pdpp.connector-scenario/1` (src/scenario/format.ts) JSON file to
 * `--out` or the default `runs/<connector>/<iso>-scenario.json` (runs/ is
 * gitignored — this is a local capture artifact, not a committed fixture).
 *
 * capture.evidence_class is computed MECHANICALLY from what this run actually
 * observed — never a hardcoded constant (see src/scenario/format.ts's
 * `ScenarioEvidenceClass` and this file's `computeEvidenceClass`).
 * `evidence_class: "synthetic-spike"` when (a) `--entrypoint` bypassed the
 * production connector registry, (b) every observed request stayed on
 * loopback (`provider_contact.loopback_only`), or (c) zero requests were
 * observed at all. `evidence_class: "non_loopback_contact_observed"` ONLY
 * when none of those hold — i.e. this run genuinely contacted the
 * connector's own registered entrypoint's real (non-loopback) upstream at
 * least once. (P1-2, repair wave 3A: this is deliberately NOT named
 * "derived-from-real" — that label claims a verified provider identity this
 * harness does not check; see format.ts's `ScenarioEvidenceClass` doc
 * comment.) `capture.provider_contact` carries the observed evidence this
 * classification is grounded in.
 * capture.privacy_class is "local-only": the scenario file may contain real
 * response bodies from the developer's own account and must not be
 * committed or shared without a scrub pass.
 *
 * capture.complete reflects recorder finalization honestly per the task's
 * verification-capture semantics: if ANY interaction fails to record, or
 * either subprocess run fails to reach a "succeeded" DONE, the scenario
 * (if written at all) is marked complete:false and this command exits
 * non-zero. A scenario with complete:false must not be treated as a
 * trustworthy replay fixture (see format.ts's ScenarioCapture doc comment).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm exec tsx bin/scenario-record.ts <connector> [--runs 1|2] [--out <path>]
 *     [--answer <id-or-index>=<value>]... [--answers <json-file>] [--persist-otp]
 *     [--streams <name,name,...>] [--timeout <seconds>] [--record-har]
 *
 * Example (the real developer flow — live capture against your own account):
 *   pnpm exec tsx bin/scenario-record.ts oura
 *   pnpm exec tsx bin/scenario-record.ts oura --runs 1 --out /tmp/oura-run1.json
 *   pnpm exec tsx bin/scenario-record.ts ynab --streams transactions,accounts
 *   pnpm exec tsx bin/scenario-record.ts chatgpt --record-har
 *
 * ─── `--record-har` (browser-driven connectors) ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The fetch-preload capture above (`writeRecordPreload`) patches
 * `globalThis.fetch` INSIDE the connector's Node process. A browser-driven
 * connector's traffic never touches that process's fetch/http/net — it
 * originates inside a separate Chromium the connector drives via
 * `src/browser-launch.ts` — so the fetch preload structurally cannot see it.
 * `--record-har` closes that gap at the NETWORK layer (not DOM/rrweb —
 * chosen to match this harness's existing recorded request/response shape):
 * it sets `PDPP_SCENARIO_HAR_RECORD_PATH`/`PDPP_SCENARIO_STORAGE_STATE_RECORD_PATH`
 * (browser-launch.ts) on the spawned subprocess's env for each run, which
 * `acquireBrowserForConnector` reads and turns into Playwright's `recordHar`
 * option plus a `context.storageState()` snapshot at context-close time. Off
 * by default; a normal fetch-only connector run is completely unaffected —
 * see browser-launch.ts's `AcquireIsolatedBrowserOptions.harRecording` doc
 * comment for the "byte-identical launch options when omitted" guarantee.
 *
 * A run that actually produces a usable HAR (nonzero entries) + storageState
 * gets `run.environment.network` stamped `driver: "recorded-browser"`
 * (format.ts's `ScenarioBrowserNetworkDriver`) with `har_path`/
 * `storage_state_path` written NEXT TO the scenario JSON (same directory,
 * relative filenames — `<scenario-basename>.run<N>.har` /
 * `.run<N>.storage-state.json`) and `har_entry_count` stamped from the HAR
 * this recorder actually wrote. A fetch-only connector run with
 * `--record-har` passed (harmless no-op: it never launches a browser, so it
 * never produces a HAR) — or any run where recording was requested but a
 * crash/SIGKILL left no usable HAR — keeps the TRUE `recorded-http` driver
 * instead: this recorder NEVER claims `recorded-browser` just because the
 * flag was passed (see `resolveRunEnvironment`'s doc comment). The capture
 * INSTANT is the SAME `run.clock.fixed_now` every run already stamps
 * (pre-existing, driver-neutral) — no separate/parallel clock mechanism.
 *
 * SECRET HYGIENE: browser-launch.ts's `release()` redacts the HAR in place
 * before this CLI ever reads it — Cookie/Set-Cookie/Authorization/
 * x-csrf-token/x-xsrf-token headers and HAR `cookies[]` entries (both
 * request and response sides) are stripped (name kept, value replaced), and
 * form-encoded POST bodies whose field names look like credentials
 * (password/secret/token/otp/pin) are blanked — see browser-launch.ts's
 * "HAR secret-hygiene pass" module section for the exact posture, which
 * matches (does not invent a parallel philosophy from) this file's existing
 * `isCredentialsPrompt`/`isOtpPrompt` redaction for Collection Profile
 * INTERACTION prompts. Response/request BODY CONTENT is NOT redacted (a HAR
 * body is an opaque blob with unknown shape — this harness cannot safely
 * apply per-field redaction to it the way it does for the fetch-preload's
 * structured JSON capture), and the storageState file is DELIBERATELY
 * UNREDACTED (a session cookie's value IS the credential replay needs to
 * stay logged in — see `AcquireIsolatedBrowserOptions.storageStateRecording`'s
 * doc comment). Both files are `capture.privacy_class: "local-only"`
 * territory, same as the scenario JSON itself — never committed or shared
 * without a manual scrub pass. `main()` prints exactly what was and was not
 * redacted after every `--record-har` run (`printBrowserCaptureSummary`).
 *
 * NO AUTOMATIC RE-RECORD: this flag only ever runs on an explicit human
 * invocation of this CLI. There is no timer, interval, or staleness-driven
 * re-capture anywhere in this file or in browser-launch.ts — the VCR
 * `re_record_interval` failure mode (a cassette silently re-recorded on a
 * schedule, quietly changing what a "PASS" means) has no equivalent here.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP, VERIFIED UNEXERCISED: `recordHar` does not capture WebSocket/
 * EventSource/SSE frames, and a browser download's body can bypass HAR
 * capture entirely (Playwright's HAR machinery is HTTP request/response
 * only). Checked against the connector fleet as of this change: zero of the
 * 45 connectors use either surface — a documented boundary, not a defect
 * discovered by a failing capture.
 *
 * ─── `--timeout <seconds>` (inactivity watchdog) ──────────────────────────
 *
 * LIVE INCIDENT: a real scoped ynab capture ran 9m20s and died with
 * "subprocess timed out" as a stack trace. Run 1 (full refresh) fit under
 * the old fixed 300s TOTAL-DURATION kill; run 2 (incremental) was executing
 * CORRECTLY — ynab's audited pacing is ~20s/request, so a ~13-request run
 * lawfully needs ~4.5 minutes — and was SIGKILLed by the harness's own
 * arbitrary ceiling, unrelated to whether the connector was making progress.
 *
 * This CLI now watches for INACTIVITY, not total duration: the window
 * resets on every byte of child stdout/stderr, so a paced connector (which
 * emits PROGRESS/RECORD lines between requests) never trips it — only a
 * genuine hang does. Default window is 300s (same number, honest inactivity
 * semantics); `--timeout <seconds>` overrides it (must be a positive
 * integer). An INTERACTION prompt pending a human's answer at a TTY
 * suspends the watchdog entirely for as long as the human takes — see
 * `createInactivityWatchdog`'s doc comment. On fire: no stack trace, just
 * the plain verdict plus whatever this run had observed so far (per-stream
 * record counts, last message seen and how long ago) — the capture is
 * incomplete by rule.
 *
 * ─── `--streams <a,b,c>` ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Mirrors `bin/connector-dev.ts`'s `--streams` flag exactly — same ergonomics
 * argument (stream scoping is not a new concept; `START.scope.streams`
 * already exists), same filtering of the manifest's stream list, same
 * fail-fast on an unknown name naming the manifest's actual streams. Applied
 * BEFORE every run in this capture (run 1 and, when `--runs 2`, run 2), so
 * the whole captured scenario is scoped consistently — `expected.records`
 * naturally only has entries for the scoped streams, because the recorder
 * only ever asks the connector to touch those streams. That composes
 * correctly with `scenario-verify`'s stream-set equality check
 * (src/scenario/verify.ts's FIX 2a): replay re-sends the SAME scope this
 * recorder wrote to `run.start.scope` (verified: `scenario-verify.ts`'s
 * `streamNamesFromScenario` reads `run.start.scope` verbatim, never
 * rebuilding it from the manifest), so the expected and actual stream sets
 * being compared are both already scoped to the same subset — apples to
 * apples, not a scoped capture against a full-manifest replay expectation.
 *
 * Motivating case: a real `ynab` run took 75 minutes, dominated by one paced
 * stream (see connector-dev.ts's matching doc comment for the concrete
 * numbers) — recording a full scenario for iteration on `transactions`/
 * `accounts` alone doesn't need to pay that cost every capture.
 *

 * `--entrypoint <path>` is a dev/test-only override, mirroring
 * `bin/connector-dev.ts`'s `--entrypoint` flag: bypasses the
 * `KNOWN_CONNECTOR_NAMES` manifest-registry lookup and runs the given file
 * directly (single synthetic `items` stream), so bin/scenario-cli.test.ts
 * can drive this CLI end-to-end against a test-only fixture connector
 * without registering it as a production connector or touching the network.
 *
 * Exit code: 0 on a complete, successful two-run (or one-run) capture;
 * non-zero on any recording failure (subprocess spawn error, a run that
 * doesn't reach a succeeded DONE, or a storage failure in the preload).
 *
 * ─── Interaction answering (captured into the scenario) ──────────────────
 *
 * If the connector emits a Collection Profile INTERACTION mid-run, this CLI
 * answers it exactly the way `bin/connector-dev.ts` does — same
 * `--answer`/`--answers` flag surface, same TTY-prompt fallback via
 * `src/interaction-handler.ts`'s `handleInteraction`, same fail-loud
 * behavior on a non-TTY run with no matching answer — and records the
 * prompt/response pair into that run's `ScenarioRun.user_interactions`
 * (src/scenario/format.ts, additive). `scenario-verify` replays these
 * scripted, in order, so a captured run with an unanswered/failed
 * interaction is not something `scenario-verify` could later replay
 * successfully anyway; recording still writes the scenario (with
 * `capture.complete: false`, per the existing "run didn't reach succeeded
 * DONE" path) so the failure is visible in the artifact rather than losing
 * the whole run's evidence.
