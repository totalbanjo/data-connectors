/**
 * scenario-verify — the offline-replay half of the developer capture→verify
 * loop for the connector-verification scenario harness (src/scenario/*.ts).
 *
 * Replays every run in a `pdpp.connector-scenario/1` scenario file (as
 * written by bin/scenario-record.ts) strictly offline against the REAL
 * connector code, running as a subprocess exactly like bin/connector-dev.ts
 * and bin/scenario-record.ts do. No live egress is possible: the
 * subprocess's `globalThis.fetch` is patched via a NODE_OPTIONS preload
 * (src/scenario/subprocess-fetch-preloads.ts's `writeReplayBridgePreload`)
 * that forwards every request over a loopback-only HTTP bridge to THIS
 * process's real `createReplayFetch(run, scenario.normalizers)` instance —
 * the same instance `verifyScenario` (src/scenario/verify.ts) constructs and
 * tracks for `assertAllConsumed()`. There is no code path in this file that
 * reaches the real network; the bridge server binds to 127.0.0.1 only and
 * its only handler is the in-memory replay matcher.
 *
 * This is the exact pattern connectors/oura/scenario.spike.test.ts proved
 * against the real (unmodified) oura connector — this CLI generalizes that
 * proof to any connector by resolving the entrypoint from the manifest
 * registry (or `--entrypoint` for dev/test) instead of hardcoding oura.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm exec tsx bin/scenario-verify.ts <connector> <scenario-path> [--timeout <seconds>]
 *
 * Example:
 *   pnpm exec tsx bin/scenario-verify.ts oura runs/oura/2026-08-13T00-00-00-000Z-scenario.json
 *
 * `--entrypoint <path>` mirrors bin/connector-dev.ts's dev/test-only
 * override, letting bin/scenario-cli.test.ts drive this CLI end-to-end
 * against a test-only fixture connector.
 *
 * `--timeout <seconds>` overrides the inactivity watchdog's default 300s
 * window — see this file's "Inactivity watchdog" section (above
 * `runReplaySubprocess`) for why replay needs the same fix
 * bin/scenario-record.ts's recording side does: a replayed connector is
 * ALSO paced (its own governor sleeps run in real time during replay, since
 * this CLI drives the exact same connector code as a real subprocess), so a
 * fixed total-duration kill was just as wrong here.
 *
 * Exit code: 0 when every run passes; non-zero when any run fails (prints
 * the structured failure list `verifyScenario` returns) or the scenario
 * file/connector can't be resolved at all.
 *
 * ─── Scripted interaction replay ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `src/scenario/verify.ts`'s `verifyScenario`/`createReplayFetch` (replay.ts)
 * only replay HTTP interactions — they know nothing about the Collection
 * Profile INTERACTION protocol. This CLI layers scripted interaction replay
 * on top, entirely within `runReplaySubprocess`/`runCollector` below: when
 * the replaying subprocess emits an INTERACTION, this CLI answers it from
 * `scenario.runs[runIndex].user_interactions`, IN ORDER (the same seq-ordered
 * "next recorded pair" discipline `replay.ts` uses for HTTP interactions).
 * This is strict, matching the harness's existing philosophy:
 *   - An INTERACTION with no next recorded `user_interactions` entry left to
 *     serve is a replay failure (an unscripted prompt the scenario never
 *     captured an answer for) — thrown as an `Error` inside `runCollector`,
 *     which `verifyScenario`'s `verifyRun` catches and reports as this run's
 *     `replay_mismatch` failure (see src/scenario/verify.ts).
 *   - Any recorded `user_interactions` entries left UNCONSUMED after the run
 *     finishes (the connector never asked for them) also fail the run —
 *     checked after `runCollector` returns and, likewise, thrown so
 *     `verifyRun` reports it under `replay_mismatch`.
 * OTP-style response values (`user_interactions[].response.value`/`.data`)
 * are redacted by DEFAULT, exactly like credentials — see
 * `bin/scenario-record.ts`'s `--persist-otp` flag (P2-1, repair wave 3A).
 * Only when a scenario was captured WITH `--persist-otp` does this file
 * replay a real OTP value verbatim from the scenario file; a redacted
 * `user_interactions` entry (OTP or credentials) is refused outright by this
 * CLI, the same way (see format.ts's `ScenarioUserInteraction` doc comment
 * and this file's `scriptedInteractionResponse`/replay-refusal logic below).
 * Scenarios remain local-only regardless (never committed/shared without a
 * scrub pass).

/**
 * Determines and prints the `recorded_replay`/`coverage`/exercised-streams
 * report for a scenario that has already passed every per-run check (this
 * function is only ever called after `result.pass` is confirmed true).
 * Split out of `main` purely to keep `main`'s own cognitive complexity under
 * this package's lint ceiling — behavior is unchanged from the inline
 * version.
 *
 * FIX 1 (P1-1, repair wave 3A): a passing verification no longer
 * unconditionally prints `recorded_replay: PASS`. `evaluateClaimEligibility`
 * (src/scenario/claims.ts) decides, from the SAME facts this function
 * already has in hand (entrypoint mode, the digest observation, the declared
 * environment drivers, protocol_trace presence, and whether OS-namespace
 * isolation was actually active for this replay), whether the stronger
 * `recorded_replay` claim is honest. When it isn't, this prints the weaker
 * `diagnostic_replay: PASS` / `recorded_replay: WITHHELD` pair with the
 * specific `limitations` that caused the downgrade, plus a machine-readable
 * `claim:` line so a caller can branch on the decision without re-parsing
 * prose. `scenario status: candidate oracle` is printed unconditionally
 * (P2-2's machine-readable state — promotion machinery is future work).
